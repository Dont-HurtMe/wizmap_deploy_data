Over-the-top communications services enable direct interpersonal and interactive exchange of information via electronic communications, without connecting to the public telephone network.\nHighlights of the 34\nth\nmeeting\nThe meeting engaged in a discussion on the supervision of the NI-ICS, with the intention to explore how the related provisions of the new EECC could be addressed.\nThe supervision of the NI-ICS as provided for by the EECC is challenging as NI-ICS providers do not operate in a single country but usually offer services across all 27 Member States. The group highlighted the challenges this presents in supervising the NI-ICS. Specifically, the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) discussed the harmonised incident reporting obligations in relation to the NI-ICS. They also exchanged their views on the need for cross-border NI-ICS supervision. In addition, the group followed a presentation on BEREC’s report on harmonised metrics of regulatory relevance for NI-ICS.\nThe Regulatory Authority of Cyprus presented the new tool they developed in order to support the supervision of cybersecurity in critical sectors.  Also, the Danish Authority introduced their consolidated incident-reporting platform and the Netherlands presented their auditing mechanisms.\nIn addition, the group discussed the recent developments in relation to the request  received from the European Commission to prepare a new candidate certification scheme for 5G.\nFurther topics addressed included the following projects of  for 2021 on:\n5G Security Controls Matrix;\nWebinars on mobile network security;\n reports to be published by the end of the year on Network Function Virtualisation (NVF) techniques, SIM swapping and Consumer Outreach Strategies.\n informed the Group about its situational awareness activities, such as the Open Cyber Situational Awareness Machine (openCSAM).\nNext steps\nThe Group is expected to meet again in October in a hybrid format. The meeting foreseen will include the organisation of a separate open session, where providers will also be invited.\nAbout the meeting\nMore than 50 experts from national authorities supervising the European telecom sector in the EU, EFTA, EEA, and EU candidate countries attended the meeting held on 16\nth\nand 17\nth\nJune.\nBackground on ECASEC Expert Group, formerly known as the  Article 13a group\nEstablished in 2010, the  ECASEC expert group, formerly known as the  Article 13a group, consists of about 100 experts from national telecom security authorities from EU Member States, EFTA countries, and EU candidate countries.\nThe group is a forum for exchanging information and good practices on telecom security. It produces policy guidelines for European authorities on the implementation of EU telecom security legislation, and publishes an annual summary report about major telecom security incidents.\nThis group meets 3 times a year in order to discuss and agree on a common approach to telecom security supervision in the EU.\nFurther Information\nFor more information about the  ECASEC expert group see\n ECASEC EG portal\nIf you want to join the  telecom security mailing list, to be kept up to date about this group and our telecom security work, and to receive invitations for events and projects, please contact us via\nresilience (at) .europa.eu\n Incident Reporting webpage\nEuropean Electronic Communications Code\nContact\nFor press questions and interviews, please contact\npress (at) .europa.eu </br><br>- Source: ENISA<br>- URL: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/eu-telecom-security-authorities-discuss-the-challenges-of-over-the-top-communications-services-supervision'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity () thanks the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) for hosting the 9th edition in Hamar.\n\nThe European Cybersecurity Challenge competition closed on Thursday in Hamar, Norway. A total of\n34 teams\nrepresenting EU Member States and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, as well as the five guest teams of Canada, Georgia, Serbia, Costa Rica, Singapore and the United States of America, took part in this year’s challenge. Latvia participated as an observer.\nJuhan Lepassaar\n, EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director said: \"\nThe European Cybersecurity Challenge further expands the networking opportunities, next generations need. We have a duty to help young people find the career they are best suited for to make a significant impact in protecting digital assets and data, and ultimately secure our entire digital life\n.”\nThe\nEuropean Cybersecurity Challenge\n(ECSC) is an annual exercise, coordinated by the European Union Agency for cybersecurity, . The ECSC is intended to encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity by challenging participants and developing their skills.\nThe 2023 edition of the challenge was organised by Norwegian Technical University (NTNU). The awards were presented by Pascal Steichen, Chair of the Governing Board of the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre, and Ambassador Nicolas de La Grandville, Delegation of the European Union to Norway, to the following winning teams:\n1\nst\nplace: Germany\n2\nnd\nplace: Switzerland\n3\nrd\nplace: Denmark\nHow were the competitors challenged?\nThe ECSC consists of security-related challenges such as hardware challenges, web and mobile security, crypto puzzles, reverse engineering and forensics.\nTechnical expertise, though, is not enough to be successful in such a challenge. The participants need to work as a team in a complex environment where decision-making must be both fast and efficient.\nThe challenge day by day\nDays 1 & 3:\nTeams were faced challenges to be solved in Jeopardy format, testing their capacities in a wide range of skills.\nNetwork and system knowledge are must-have skills in order to succeed. In addition to crypto and steganography, reverse engineering and exploitation know-how are just as essential as web and mobile/wireless security. Hardware hacking scenarios require efficient teamwork and related skills to effectively manage the complexity of the tasks and ensure success.\nDay 2:\nIn the Attack & Defence exercise, the teams need to secure their own networks while, at the same time, hack the networks of the other teams. Compared to the conventional Jeopardy format, teams are faced with significantly more challenges in the Attack & Defence exercise. To be successful, it is important to detect attacks carried out by other teams through analysis of network traffic, log files or other artefacts left behind by the attackers. It is also necessary to eliminate the vulnerabilities in the applications to be protected without impairing their functionality or availability. At the same time, the assets of the other teams must be attacked in order to steal secret data (known as\nflags\n).\nThe role of interpersonal skills\nIn a challenge involving as many as\n34 teams,\nparticipants also need to handle excitement and high adrenaline levels. High levels of motivation and engagement are therefore critical to devise a smart approach. The teams that hold the keys to success are those that demonstrate extreme flexibility, responding fast to the evolving scenarios and changing strategies accordingly.\nLet’s meet again next year!\nThe 2024 edition of the European Cybersecurity Challenge will take place in\nItaly\n!

Improving the interoperability of electronic identification and authentication systems is a European task and a task for all Member States.  analysed the current situation and assessed the security risks of electronic authentication in cross-border solutions. To visualize these risks, two different projects offering cross-border authentication have been examined and evaluated, Netcards/EHIC and Stork.\nThe public services of egovernment  and health care providers are increasingly offering citizens in EU Member States electronic access to these services. These e-services are usually tailored at a national level with specific technologies, security concepts and business logic. In addition, these e-services are governed by the data protection laws of the individual Member State.\nCommon goals\nThe goals of these systems are identical for all Member States: managing identities, improving administrative efficiency, improving accessibility and user-friendliness, reducing abuse and fraud and, above all, reduction of costs. Yet, in most cases, these systems can only be accessed from within the Member State and by citizens of that state.\nMaking the digital internal market functioning\nEuropean citizens who move freely through Member States face the problem that their eID documents from their home state do not allow access to electronic services of another Member State in which they are currently present. This may be an undue restriction on EU citizens’ use of these services. Administrations, at the other hand, cannot provide services to European citizens from other Member States with the same ease and efficiency as their own citizens. So there is a need to extend these digital services beyond national borders and beyond the user group of national citizens. At the same time, European and national data protection laws and regulations must be respected and may not be undermined by cross-border distribution of personal data.\nCross Border interoperability - A task for Europe\nImproving the interoperability of electronic identification and authentication systems is thus a European task and a task for all Member States. This report visualizes the security risks of electronic authentication in cross-border solutions, in two different projects.\n-          The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) facilitates access to health care services for insured European citizens during temporary stays abroad. NETC@RDS for eEHIC ID is a pan-European project supported by the EU eTEN programme. It facilitates medical treatment of European citizens by using an electronically readable European health insurance card.\n-          STORK (Secure idenTity acrOss boRders linKed) is a large-scale pilot project in the ICT Policy Support programme to simplify administrative formalities by providing secure online access to public services across EU borders.\nCritical success factors:\n·        establishing the legal and contractual framework\n·        identifying the citizen through credentials\n·        authenticating system participants across borders\n·        making online connections secure\n·        bridging technological differences\n·        establishing and agreeing on a common security policy.\nBy covering these factors in electronic cross-border authentication, the national goals of eID solutions can be extended successfully to a pan-European solution.\nFor full report </br><br>- Source: ENISA<br>- URL: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/security-issues-in-cross-border-e-authentication'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Many cloud providers offer a variety of serverless resources, including compute engines, application integration services, and web servers. \nAdversaries may abuse these resources in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. For example, adversaries may use serverless functions to execute malicious code, such as crypto-mining malware (i.e. \n).\n Adversaries may also create functions that enable further compromise of the cloud environment. For example, an adversary may use the \n permission in AWS or the \n permission in Google Cloud to add \n to a serverless cloud function, which may then be able to perform actions the original user cannot.\nServerless functions can also be invoked in response to cloud events (i.e. \n), potentially enabling persistent execution over time.

Who audits the security? How many providers are certified?\nCCSL was first launched in April with just five certification schemes. The last months  worked with industry to add more schemes and to extend the information on the list. Now the list has 12 individual schemes, including some self-assessment schemes and some schemes commonly used overseas, like PCI DSS and AICPA SOC.\nDan Cimpean (Deloitte), one of the experts in the C-SIG working group on certification, who analysed the SOC standards, explains: “Especially in Europe, cloud stakeholders are searching for a better balance between the compliance burden and the assurance level in the cloud eco-system. More and more cloud service providers consider a SOC 2 report to effectively respond to the expectations of cloud customers for better security”.\nRalph Salomon, from SAP (a large European cloud provider), who analysed the PCI DSS standard, remarks: “SAP's intention is to provide full transparency on the security and compliance status of our cloud offerings to our customers. In Europe we don't need to re-invent certification standards as we can rely on relevant and internationally accepted standards and good practices. SAP very much appreciates and supports the CCSL initiative of European Commission and  as it provides clarity to the customers on relevance and value of standards and good practices.”\nIn the coming weeks  will also publish a framework to map from customer requirements to the security objectives in existing certification schemes.

Federation Assurance Levels </br><br>- Content: This section defines allowable Federation Assurance Levels, or FAL. The FAL describes requirements for how assertions are constructed and secured for a given transaction. These levels can be requested by an RP or required by the configuration of both the RP and the IdP for a given transaction.\n\nAll assertions SHALL be used with a federation protocol as described in [Section 4.](#page14) All assertions SHALL comply with the detailed requirements in [Section 6.](#page24) All assertions SHALL be presented using one of the methods described in [Section 7.](#page29) While many different federation implementation options are possible, the FAL is intended to provide clear implementation recommendations representing increasingly secure deployment options. Combinations of aspects not found in the FAL table are possible but outside the scope of this volume. See [SP 800-63](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3) Section 6.3 for details on how to choose the most appropriate FAL.\n\nThis table presents different requirements for each FAL. Each successive level subsumes and fulfills all requirements of lower levels. Federations presented through a proxy SHALL be represented by the lowest level used during the proxied transaction.\n\n**Table 4-1 Federation Assertion Levels**\n\n| **FAL** | **Requirement**                                             |\n|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | Bearer assertion, signed by IdP.                            |\n| 2       | Bearer assertion, signed by IdP and encrypted to RP.        |\n| 3       | Holder of key assertion, signed by IdP and encrypted to RP. |\n\nFor example, FAL1 maps to the OpenID Connect Basic Client profile or Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Web SSO Artifact Binding profile with no additional features. FAL2 additionally requires that the assertion (e.g., the OpenID Connect ID Token or SAML Assertion) be encrypted to a public key representing the RP in question. FAL3 requires the subscriber to cryptographically prove possession of a key bound to the assertion (e.g., the use of a cryptographic authenticator) along with all requirements of FAL2. The additional key presented at FAL3 need not be the same key used by the subscriber to authenticate to the IdP.\n\nRegardless of what the RP requests or what the protocol requires, the RP can easily detect the FAL in use by observing the nature of the assertion as it is presented as part of the federation protocol. Therefore, the RP is responsible for determining which FALs it is willing to accept for a given authentication transaction and ensuring that the transaction meets that FAL’s requirements.\nIf the RP is using a front-channel presentation mechanism, as defined in [Section 7.2](#page31) (e.g., the OpenID Connect Implicit Client profile or the SAML Web SSO profile), it SHALL require FAL2 or greater in order to protect the information in the assertion from disclosure to the browser or other parties in the transaction other than the intended RP.\n\nAdditionally, the IdP SHALL employ appropriately-tailored security controls (to include control enhancements) from the moderate or high baseline of security controls defined in [SP 800-53](#page49) or equivalent federal (e.g., [FEDRAMP](#page48)) or industry standard.\n </br><br>- Source: nist 800-63c-3<br>- URL: <a href='https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63c.pdf'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Length </br><br>- Content: Password length is a primary factor in characterizing password strength [Strength] [Composition]. Passwords that are too short yield to brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks. The minimum password length required depends on the threat model being addressed. Online attacks in which the attacker attempts to log in by guessing the password can be mitigated by limiting the permitted login attempt rate. To prevent an attacker (or a persistent claimant with poor typing skills) from quickly inflicting a denial-of-service attack on the subscriber by making many incorrect guesses, passwords need to be complex enough that a reasonable number of attempts can be permitted with a low probability of a successful guess, and rate limiting can be applied before there is a significant chance of a successful guess.Offline attacks are sometimes possible when the attacker obtains one or more hashed passwords through a database breach. The ability of the attacker to determine one or more users’ passwords depends on how the password is stored. Commonly, passwords are salted with a random value and hashed, preferably using a computationally expensive algorithm. Even with such measures, the current ability of attackers to compute many billions of hashes per second in an offline environment that is not subject to rate limiting requires passwords to be orders of magnitude more complex than those expected to resist only online attacks.Users should be encouraged to make their passwords as lengthy as they want, within reason. Since the size of a hashed password is independent of its length, there is no reason to prohibit the use of lengthy passwords (or passphrases) if the user wishes. Extremely long passwords (perhaps megabytes long) could require excessive processing time to hash, so it is reasonable to have some limit. </br><br>- Source: nist 800-63b-4<br>- URL: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Requesting and Processing xALs </br><br>- Content: Since an IdP is capable of asserting the identities of many different subscribers with a variety of authenticators using a variety of federation parameters, the IAL, AAL, and FAL could vary across different federation transactions, even to the same RP.IdPs SHALL support a mechanism for RPs to specify a set of minimum acceptable xALs as part of the trust agreement and SHOULD support the RP specifying a more strict minimum set at runtime as part of the federation transaction. When an RP requests a particular xAL, the IdP SHOULD fulfill that request, if possible, and SHALL indicate the resulting xAL in the assertion. For example, if the subscriber has an active session that was authenticated at AAL1, but the RP has requested AAL2, the IdP needs to prompt the subscriber for AAL2 authentication to step up the security of the session at the IdP during the subscriber’s interaction at the IdP, if possible. The IdP sends the resulting AAL as part of the returned assertion, whether it is AAL1 (the step-up authentication was not met) or AAL2 (the step-up authentication was met successfully).The IdP SHALL inform the RP of the following information for each federation transaction:The IAL of the subscriber account being presented to the RP, or an indication that no IAL claim is being madeThe AAL of the currently active session of the subscriber at the IdP, or an indication that no AAL claim is being madeThe FAL of the federation transactionThe RP gets this xAL information from a combination of the terms of the trust agreement as described in Sec. 3.4 and information included in the assertion as described in Sec. 4.9 and Sec. 5.8. If the xAL is unchanging for all messages between the IdP and RP, the xAL information SHALL be included in the terms of the trust agreement between the IdP and RP. If the xAL could be within a range of possible values specified by the trust agreement, the xAL information SHALL be included as part of the assertion contents.The IdP MAY indicate that no claim is made to the IAL or AAL for a given federation transaction. In such cases, no default value is assigned to the resulting xAL by the RP. That is to say, a federation transaction without an IAL declaration in either the trust agreement or the assertion is functionally considered to have “no IAL” and the RP cannot assume the account meets “IAL1”, the lowest numbered IAL described in this suite.The RP SHALL determine the minimum IAL, AAL, and FAL it is willing to accept for access to any offered functionality. An RP MAY vary its functionality based on the IAL, AAL, and FAL of a specific federated authentication. For example, an RP can allow federation transactions at AAL2 for common functionality (e.g., viewing the status of a dam system) but require AAL3 be used for higher risk functionality (e.g., changing the flow rates of a dam system). Similarly, an RP could restrict management functionality to only certain subscriber accounts which have been identity proofed at IAL2, while allowing federation transactions from all subscriber accounts regardless of IAL.In a federation process, only the IdP has direct access to the details of the subscriber account, which determines the applicable IAL, and the authentication event at the IdP, which determines the applicable AAL. Consequently, the IdP declares the IAL, AAL, and intended FAL for each federation transaction.The RP SHALL ensure that it meets its obligations in the federation transaction for the FAL declared in the assertion. For example, the RP needs to ensure the presentation method meets the injection protection requirements at FAL2 and above, and that the appropriate bound authenticator is presented at FAL3. </br><br>- Source: nist 800-63c-4<br>- URL: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

It describes the specific European situation, and discusses the advantages and challenges towards a more harmonised certification practice.\nThe report, aims to attract the interest of the smart grid experts and the support of certification authorities on open issues of security certification in smart grid environments. The increasing need for smart grid certification derives from the lack of control over the power supply chain (cables, solar panels, wind turbines, etc.), introduced by smart grid automation.\nUdo Helmbrecht\ncommented on the project: ‘\nSmart grid and renewable energy are very promising for the European industry. Security certification is an important tool towards increasing users’ trust on the energy power supply chain. In this report,  provides recommendations which support certification authorities in reflecting upon their national security requirements and at the same time pave the way towards improved harmonisation of European smart grid certification practices”.\nWithin this framework,  provides\nten\nrecommendations to Member States and the European Commission. These are:\nThe European Commission should appoint an EU steering committee to coordinate smart grid certification activities\nThe EU steering committee should provide guidance and a reference model to implement a chain of trust\nThe EU steering committee should perform a mapping exercise amongst available standards and schemes used in the EU\nThe EU steering committee should promote international recognition of schemes such as SOG-IS\nThe EU steering committee should promote validation that is commensurate with the risk appetite involved in each use smart grid case\nThe EU steering committee should facilitate flexibility to update protection profiles so they can cope with the fast moving security threat landscape\nThe Member States should use national profiles as detailed specifications of international standards to cover the specific national use cases and nationally supported test and certification methods\nThe European Commission should ask technical committees, in collaboration with the European energy associations, to create European profiles\nThe EU steering committee should encourage the provision of tools in respect to the proposed certification framework, while the national technical committees should provide pre-assessment tools for specific schemes\nThe European Commission and the Member States should promote compliance and harmonization as economic advantage and a cost reduction measure.\nThe report, builds on the findings of the\nsecurity certification of smart grid components\nworkshop in 2012, co-organised by DG-CNECT and  in Brussels. The key message is that Europe needs more harmonised smart grid security certification practices, as a means to lower certification cost. Further, the report is the result of consultation with smart grid security certification experts, and has been validated by security experts, in a\nworkshop held in Heidelberg\nin September 2014.\nFor the full report:\nhttps://www..europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/smart-grids-and-smart-metering/smart-grid-security-certification/\nFor inquiries:\nDr. Konstantinos Moulinos, Security & Resilience of Communication Networks Officer, ,\nEmail:\nKonstantinos.Moulinos@.europa.eu\n,\nPhone:\n+30 2814409629. </br><br>- Source: ENISA<br>- URL: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/smart-grid-security-certification-in-europe-challenges-and-recommendations'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

It reminds us that we can easily step up our own cybersecurity by getting into some good digital habits. By being alert against scammers we can stay safe.”\nThierry Breton\n, Commissioner for Internal Market added: “\nScammers are getting more creative in their ways of attacking individuals and organisations. It is therefore essential to stay alert with new technology and to take our online safety very seriously. Cyber threats are evolving at a rapid pace and citizens’ behaviour can play a fundamental role in how we stay cyber secure - it is our shared responsibility\n.”\n Executive Director,\nJuhan Lepassaar\nadded:\n\"One of the weakest links in cybersecurity is humans. Explaining how social engineering works in practice, creates awareness of potential traps.”\nThe official kick-off of the campaign will take place at the\nCyber Days 2023\nevent of the European Parliament on 26, 27 and 28 September.\nWhat is social engineering?\nSocial engineering occurs when someone is manipulated into performing actions or giving up sensitive and/or personal information. Scammers will use the information disclosed by the victims in tricky ways meant to deceive them. This is how attackers take advantage of their victim’s trust in digital communications. Being tricked into performing an action is how we unconsciously help attackers to perform the attack they have devised.\n identifies and analyses current and future cyber threats including the trends around social engineering. The increase in collection of behavioural data can lead to more targeted phishing attacks. The use of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and automation by machine learning allow attackers to analyse user behaviour and launch targeted attacks.\nThe  Threat Landscape has found that phishing has become the most common initial vector, meaning social engineering is the most popular attack type to gain access to an organisation. Once attackers have access to the inside of an organisation, further attacks can be carried out such as ransomware.\nThe campaign will draw the attention of users of all ages to the different social engineering techniques used by attackers against them and enable them exercise caution. Activities and information will be provided to help them get familiar with the various ways in which they can be tricked by cyber criminals. They will also learn how to identify and spot potential scams.\nThe 2023 ECSM awards: who are the lucky winners this year?\nThe ECSM Awards is an initiative which aims to highlight successful and/or innovative promotional material produced by EU Member States (MS) over the years.\nThe awards fall under three categories:  Best video, best infographic, & best educational material and the winning material is promoted alongside the ECSM campaign during October.\nAnd the 2023 winners are:\nBest video from Slovenia:\nSafe at the office\n(173) Vodstvo | Varni v pisarni #ECSM - YouTube\nBest infographic from Greece:\nIdentity Theft Online\nInfographic: Κλοπή Ταυτότητας στο Διαδίκτυο – Identity Theft Online | SaferInternet4kids\nBest teaching material from Czechia:\nCyber Fairy tales\nCYBER FAIRY TALES – EDUCATIONAL WEBSITE FOR CHILDREN, YOUTH AND TEACHERS (kyberpohadky.cz)\nAbout the ECSM\nThe European Cybersecurity Month (ECSM) is the European Union’s annual campaign dedicated to promoting cybersecurity among citizens and organisations, and to providing up-to-date digital security information through awareness raising and the sharing of good practices. Each year, for the entire month of October, hundreds of activities take place across Europe, including conferences, workshops, trainings, webinars, presentations, online quizzes and more, to provide resources for citizens to learn more about protecting themselves online. The ECSM has been coordinated by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity () for over 10 years and is supported by The European Commission, Europol, The European Central Bank and EU Member States, EFTA countries, and more than 300 partners (governments, universities, think tanks, NGOs, professional associations, businesses) from Europe and beyond.

Technologies have been developed with properties that improve both the resilience and security of the Internet. Experience is missing in the area of commercial operation of these features, as well as operational best practices and recommendations in applied network resilience.\nResilience and security of communication networks and services that they support is an issue of critical importance to the EU economy and its citizens, as it impacts day-to-day operation of businesses, affecting daily lives of EU citizens.\n carried out an assessment of three key technologies Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) and Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) regarding their potential to provide increased network resilience. This analysis was carried out from two perspectives. The first consisted of analysing the characteristics of the selected technologies and their public communication network's resilience enhancing features. In parallel, the effectiveness of these technologies, as well as problems and gaps that potentially could compromise the availability of networks and services was assessed through interviews of twelve network operators in the EU Member States.\nThe key findings of the analysis are:\nThe assessed technologies can improve both the resilience and security of the Internet.\nCommercial operation experience is missing for some of the technologies.\nThere are neither operational best practices nor recommendations for applied network resilience.\nThere is lack of management and coordination between stakeholders.\nThe Agency commented:\n“The recent spotlight in the news on networks unavailability, caused by cyber attacks and physical phenomena, highlights the urgency and the importance of ’s work on improving the resilience of public communications. This is an area vital for European e-government, e-business and ultimately, the economy.”\nThe three key recommendations are:\nResilient connectivity of European organisations must be ensured.\nEuropean expertise, best practice and operational experience must be exploited.\nThe existence of European trained experts should be ensured.\nBackground\n’s\nMultiannual Thematic Program\nhas the objective to improve the resilience of public eCommunications in Europe.\nThe full report is available at:\nResilience report </br><br>- Source: ENISA<br>- URL: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/improving-resilience-3-tips'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 268/67 (IT) Friday, July 26, 2024. The University of Michigan Medical Center (Michigan Medicine) has been affected by a data breach affecting 56,953 patients. The incident resulted in the disclosure of personal and health information of patients. Michigan Medicine reported that attackers gained access to employee email accounts on May 23 and 29.  The agency responded to the incident by blocking the IP used by the attackers and changing the passwords of the hacked accounts.  Following an investigation of the incident, Michigan Medicine found no evidence to suggest that the goal of the attack was to steal patients' health information.  This analysis, which took place between June 10-27, 2024, found that emails and attachments containing information that could identify patients and health insurance guarantors were accessed in the incident.  The compromised information includes names, medical record numbers, addresses, dates of birth, diagnostic and treatment information, and health insurance details.  The disclosed information varies from person to person. Michigan Medicine clarified that financial information, such as credit card numbers, debit cards, or bank account numbers, was not compromised in this incident. However, the Social Security numbers of four patients were found to have been exposed in this incident.

Another way to accomplish this is by forging or spoofing\n the identity of the sender which can be used to fool both the human recipient as well as automated security tools.\n \nPhishing for information may also involve evasive techniques, such as removing or manipulating emails or metadata/headers from compromised accounts being abused to send messages (e.g., \n). </br><br>- Source: MITRE<br>- URL: <a href='https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598'>Link Document</a> </br>", "2020", 1]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 326/67 (IT) Tuesday, September 17, 2024. Researchers from Aqua Security discovered new malware called \"Hadooken,\" which attacks WebLogic servers.  The malware's name comes from an attack move in the game Street Fighter.  Hadooken's capabilities include installing cryptocurrency mining software (cryptominer) and deploying Tsunami malware, which can be used for later system breaches.  This attack targets WebLogic servers, developed by Oracle and often used in large organizations. Attackers gain access to the servers through weak passwords. They then use shell scripts and Python to download and install the malware on the server, while also attempting to hide traces of the attack. Researchers found that the Hadooken malware was downloaded from two IP addresses: 89.185.85.102 (still active), registered in Germany, and 185.174.136.204 (no longer active), registered in Russia.  The still-active IP has been linked to the TeamTNT and Gang 8220 groups. However, researchers do not yet have enough evidence to confirm the source of this attack.  Searching for additional information through Shodan revealed more than 230,000 WebLogic servers connected to the internet. Although most are well-protected, some may be vulnerable to attack.

In other cases in association with path traversal, the attacker can specify a local file that may contain executable statements that can be parsed by PHP.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nStrategy: Libraries or Frameworks\nUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nStrategy: Enforcement by Conversion\nWhen the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.\nFor example, ID 1 could map to \"inbox.txt\" and ID 2 could map to \"profile.txt\". Features such as the ESAPI AccessReferenceMap [\nREF-185\n] provide this capability.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nFor any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid\nCWE-602\n. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\nPhases: Architecture and Design; Operation\nStrategy: Sandbox or Jail\nRun the code in a \"jail\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.\nOS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.\nThis may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.\nBe careful to avoid\nCWE-243\nand other weaknesses related to jails.\nEffectiveness: Limited\nNote:\nThe effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.\nPhases: Architecture and Design; Operation\nStrategy: Environment Hardening\nRun your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [\nREF-76\n]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Input Validation\nAssume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\nWhen validating filenames, use stringent lists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \".\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as\nCWE-23\n, and exclude directory separators such as \"/\" to avoid\nCWE-36\n. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid\nCWE-434\n.\nDo not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (\nCWE-184\n). For example, filtering \"/\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \"\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (\nCWE-182\n). For example, if \"../\" sequences are removed from the \".../...//\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \"../\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \"../\" string.\nEffectiveness: High\nPhases: Architecture and Design; Operation\nStrategy: Attack Surface Reduction\nStore library, include, and utility files outside of the web document root, if possible. Otherwise, store them in a separate directory and use the web server's access control capabilities to prevent attackers from directly requesting them. One common practice is to define a fixed constant in each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately.\nThis significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce the attack surface.\nPhases: Architecture and Design; Implementation\nStrategy: Attack Surface Reduction\nUnderstand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.\nMany file inclusion problems occur because the programmer assumed that certain inputs could not be modified, especially for cookies and URL components.\nPhase: Operation\nStrategy: Firewall\nUse an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.\nEffectiveness: Moderate\nNote:\nAn application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.\nPhases: Operation; Implementation\nStrategy: Environment Hardening\nDevelop and run your code in the most recent versions of PHP available, preferably PHP 6 or later. Many of the highly risky features in earlier PHP interpreters have been removed, restricted, or disabled by default.\nPhases: Operation; Implementation\nStrategy: Environment Hardening\nWhen using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as\nCWE-95\n,\nCWE-621\n, and similar issues.\nOften, programmers do not protect direct access to files intended only to be included by core programs. These include files may assume that critical variables have already been initialized by the calling program. As a result, the use of register_globals combined with the ability to directly access the include file may allow attackers to conduct file inclusion attacks. This remains an extremely common pattern as of 2009.\nPhase: Operation\nStrategy: Environment Hardening\nSet allow_url_fopen to false, which limits the ability to include files from remote locations.\nEffectiveness: High\nNote:\nBe aware that some versions of PHP will still accept ftp:// and other URI schemes. In addition, this setting does not protect the code from path traversal attacks (\nCWE-22\n), which are frequently successful against the same vulnerable code that allows remote file inclusion.\n</br><br>- Source: OWASP<br>- URL: <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/98.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 1]

The report underlines a need for:\n•    more cyber security exercises in the future,\n•     increased collaboration between the Member States,\n•     the importance of the private sector in ensuring security.\nSupporting EU-wide cyber security preparedness exercises is an EU priority in  its ‘\nDigital Agenda for Europe\n’, as to ensure that businesses and citizens are secure online.  The Agency also released\nan online video clip to support the report.\n'Cyber Europe 2010' was conducted on the 4th of November 2010. Its objective  was to trigger communication and collaboration between countries to respond to large-scale cyber-attacks. Over 70 Experts from the participating public bodies worked together to counter +300 simulated hacking  attacks aimed at  paralysing the Internet and critical online services across Europe. During the exercise, a simulated loss of Internet connectivity between the countries took place,  requiring cross border cooperation to avoid a ( simulated)  total network crash.\nThe evaluation of the exercise was conducted at three levels:\n1.    National\n2.    Pan-European\n3.    Overall\nKey findings\ninclude that:\n•    Member States Information Technology bodies communicate in a wide variety of ways. Harmonisation of standard operating procedures would lead to more secure and efficient communication between them.\n•    The ability to find the relevant points of contact within organisations varied. In the event of a real crisis, some 55 % of countries were not confident they would be able to quickly identify the right contact, even with the available directories.\n•    Participants were evenly divided  on whether a  ‘Single Point of Contact’ (SPOC) or ‘Multiple Points of Contact’ (MPOC) would be better. A SPOC would be easier, but realistically, today there are multiple points of contact. MPOC also avoids a single point of failure.\nThe\nmain recommendations\ninclude that:\n•    Europe should continue to hold exercises in Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP): 86% of the participants found the ‘dry run’ ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ useful.\n•    The private sector should  provide value in future exercises by increasing  levels of realism\n•    ‘Lessons Identified’ should be exchanged with those holding other (national or international) exercises\n•    Member States should be well organised internally,  for example, by developing and testing national contingency plans and exercises:\nEuropean countries are organised nationally in a variety of ways. Given the differences in structures and process, it is vital to know whom to contact.\nThe dialogue on the necessity of Single Point of Contact or Multiple Points of Contact at the EU level should continue, and  can be the facilitator of this.\n•    A roadmap for pan-EU exercises should be created. This would include  a definition of standard procedures and structures for large scale events.\n“The Cyber Europe  report identifies how we can make our online economic and social activity more secure.  is dedicated to supporting European exercises, processes and plans to protect the Information Communications Technology  infrastructure on which  we are all increasingly dependent, ”  says\nProf. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of .\nA\nvideo clip\non 'Cyber Europe 2010' is available here\nFor background:\nCritical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) Action Plan\nDigital Agenda for Europe\nand the\nEarlier press releases;\n5th Nov.

A rapidly increasing number of Industry 4.0 cybersecurity incidents emerge, additionally stressing the need to strengthen cyber resilience.\nThis is particularly true for industrial operators who are beginning to utilise the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 solutions. The need to improve cybersecurity of Industry 4.0 is even more important, since the potential impact of relevant threats ranges from compromising physical security to production downtimes, spoilage of products to damaging equipment as well as ensuing financial and reputational losses.\nThe guidelines and security measures listed in this study by  aim at improving the cybersecurity posture of Industry 4.0 organisations that have adopted or plan to adopt industrial IoT devices and solutions that enhance automation in industrial operations. These security measures apply to a wide audience, spanning from industrial IoT operators to manufacturers/vendors, which can utilise these measures and recommendations as a checklist to examine their security setup regarding their Industry 4.0 solutions.\nSteve Purser, head of Core Operations Department at , said: “The advanced digitalisation envisaged within the Industry 4.0 framework is a paradigm shift in the way industries operate and blurs the boundaries between the physical and digital world. With a great impact on citizens’ safety, security and privacy due to its cyber-physical nature, the security challenges concerning Industry 4.0 and IoT are significant. Today,  publishes the study that addresses those challenges and, combined with the baseline IoT security work, lies the foundations for a secure industrial IoT ecosystem. IoT, together with Industry 4.0 cybersecurity, are the springboard for a safer and more resilient connected world.”\nThe study makes a series of contributions. Most notably, it\ndefines relevant terminology (i.e. terms such as Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing, industrial IoT),\ncategorises the Industry 4.0 assets in a comprehensive taxonomy across the manufacturing process and value chain,\nintroduces a detailed Industry 4.0 threat taxonomy based on related risks and attack scenarios, and\nlists security measures related to the use of IoT in smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 and maps them against the threats and affected assets.\nAdditionally, the study presents existing security initiatives, standards and schemes.  reviewed more than 150 resources on Industry 4.0 and IoT security and mapped them against the security measures proposed in this study. As a result, interested readers, who are nowadays facing a fragmented information landscape, will get a better overview resulting in a common basis of understanding.\nThe agency considered the security of Industry 4.0 devices and services throughout their whole lifecycle (from conception to end-of-life and decommissioning) and took into account the requirements that are specific for an Industry 4.0 environment. The study lists 110 security measures across 20 different security\ndomains, spanning from security and privacy by design to third-party and vulnerability management and access control and monitoring.\nWith this study,  aims at setting the scene for Industry 4.0 and industrial IoT cybersecurity across the European Union to promote necessary collaborations and raise awareness of relevant threats and risks, with a focus on “security for safety”.\nDownload the report\nhere\n. </br><br>- Source: ENISA<br>- URL: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cybersecurity-is-a-key-enabler-for-industry-4-0-adoption'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

User interaction is required for exploitation. Targets may be tricked into visiting malicious websites or opening malicious files.  The vulnerability is due to a lack of validation of user-supplied data, which can result in out-of-bounds memory access.  This allows attackers to execute code by exploiting this vulnerability. WinRAR addressed the vulnerability with the release of version 6.23. Users are advised to update their WinRAR installations before attackers can exploit the vulnerability.  </br><br>- Source: Thai-CERT<br>- URL: <a href='https://www.thaicert.or.th/2023/08/21/%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%87%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a7%e0%b9%88-winrar-%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%a7%e0%b8%a2%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%ab%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%aa%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%96/'>Link Document</a></br>", "2023", 1]

For example, if two independent RPs each see the same subscriber identified with different pairwise pseudonymous identifiers, they could still determine that the subscriber is the same person by comparing the name, email address, physical address, or other identifying attributes carried alongside the pairwise pseudonymous identifier in the respective assertions. Privacy policies SHOULD prohibit such correlation, and pairwise pseudonymous identifiers can increase effectiveness of these policies by increasing the administrative effort in managing the attribute correlation.\n\nNote that in a proxied federation model, the initial IdP may be unable to generate a pairwise pseudonymous identifier for the ultimate RP, since the proxy could blind the IdP from knowing which RP is being accessed by the subscriber. In such situations, the pairwise pseudonymous identifier is generally established between the IdP and the federation proxy itself. The proxy, acting as an IdP, can itself provide pairwise pseudonymous identifiers to downstream RPs. Depending on the protocol, the federation proxy may need to map the pairwise pseudonymous identifiers back to the associated identifiers from upstream IdPs in order to allow the identity protocol to function.

Activation secrets MAY be entirely numeric (i.e., a PIN). If alphanumeric values are permitted, all printing ASCII [RFC20] characters and the space character, SHOULD be allowed. Unicode [ISO/ISC 10646] characters SHOULD also be permitted in alphanumeric secrets. The authenticator or its management tools SHOULD implement a blocklist to discourage users from selecting commonly used activation secrets (e.g., 123456).The authenticator or verifier SHALL implement a retry-limiting mechanism that limits the number of consecutive failed activation attempts using the authenticator to no more than 10.

Very often the password recovery mechanism is weak, which has the effect of making it more likely that it would be possible for a person other than the legitimate system user to gain access to that user's account. Weak password recovery schemes completely undermine a strong password authentication scheme.\nThis weakness may be that the security question is too easy to guess or find an answer to (e.g. because the question is too common, or the answers can be found using social media). Or there might be an implementation weakness in the password recovery mechanism code that may for instance trick the system into e-mailing the new password to an e-mail account other than that of the user. There might be no throttling done on the rate of password resets so that a legitimate user can be denied service by an attacker if an attacker tries to recover their password in a rapid succession. The system may send the original password to the user rather than generating a new temporary password. In summary, password recovery functionality, if not carefully designed and implemented can often become the system's weakest link that can be misused in a way that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nMake sure that all input supplied by the user to the password recovery mechanism is thoroughly filtered and validated.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nDo not use standard weak security questions and use several security questions.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nMake sure that there is throttling on the number of incorrect answers to a security question.

Most incidents reported to regulators and  involved mobile internet and mobile telephony connections. The most frequent causes are system failures affecting mainly base stations and switches.\nThe annual report is a result of an EU wide incident reporting process which started in 2012, under Article 13a of the\nFramework Directive (2009/140/EC)\n. Incidents are reported nationally by operators to the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs). The most severe outages are reported annually by the NRAs to  and the European Commission. The main findings are summarised below:\n90 major incidents reported:\nThis year 19 countries reported 90 significant incidents while 9 countries reported no significant incidents.\nMobile networks most affected\n: Approximately half of the major outages involved mobile internet and mobile telephony.\nImpact on emergency calls:\n21% of the major incidents also had an impact on emergency calls (access to 112).\nMajority (61%) of outages caused by system failures:\nMost of the time these system failures were software bugs, hardware failures and software misconfigurations affecting switches and base stations.\nNatural phenomena have most impact in terms of user-hours lost:\nOften severe weather (heavy snowfall, storms), led to power or cable cuts, which in turn led to severe outages in terms of user-hours lost. Assets mostly affected were base stations, switches and mobile switching.\nThe Executive Director of \nProfessor Udo Helmbrecht\ncomments:\n“Public communication networks and services are the backbone of the EU's digital society. Our goal is to help increase the resilience and security of electronic communications. Incident reporting and discussing actual incidents is essential to understand the risks and what can be improved.  will continue collaborating with the EU's Telecom regulators to support efficient and effective reporting about security incidents”.\nThis annual report does not mention specific countries or providers.

However, this technology also introduces new security challenges.\nThe report\nreleased today supports national authorities with the implementation of the 5G toolbox, and in particular the recommendation for EU Member States to ensure that Mobile Network Operators follow security good practices for NFV. It explores the relevant challenges, vulnerabilities and attacks pertaining to NFV within the 5G network. It analyses the relevant security controls and recommends best practices to address these challenges and solutions, taking into account the particularities of this highly complex, heterogeneous and volatile environment.\nHow does it work?\nTraditionally, mobile network functions have been implemented using dedicated hardware and networking equipment, built especially for telecom operators and their networks. Network Function Virtualisation is a new technology used in 5G networks to implement networking functions using software, therefore running virtually on top of standard server hardware or standard cloud platforms.\nApplying network function virtualisation will therefore reduce the number of operations and maintenance costs.\n60 security challenges were identified in the report and classified under 7 categories:\nVirtualisation or containerisation;\nOrchestration and management;\nAdministration and access control;\nNew and legacy technologies;\nAdoption of open source or COTS;\nSupply chain;\nLawful interception (LI).\nHow do we address the security challenges\nThe report explores vulnerabilities, attack scenarios and their impact on the 5G NFV assets. The work includes a total of 55 best practices classified under Technical, Policy and Organisational categories.\nSome of the key findings the report include:\nResource virtualisation:\nThe virtualisation layer provides unified computing resources based on generalised hardware to the layers above and is the basis of all cloud-native and virtualised network functions and service software. If the virtualisation layer is breached, all network functions come under direct attack with disastrous consequences.\nResource sharing:\nA single physical server may run several different tenants' virtual resources (e.g. virtual machines (VMs) or containers), and a single tenant's virtual resource might be distributed across several physical servers. Multi-tenancy resource sharing and the breaking of physical boundaries introduce the risks of data leaks, data residue and attacks.\nUse of open source:\nThere will be increasing use of open-source software. This introduces a new set of security challenges in terms of keeping a consistent and coherent approach to security-by-design and prevention of deliberate security flaws.\nMulti-vendor environment\n:\nIn such environment, it remains difficult to coordinate security policies and determine responsibility for security problems and more effective network security monitoring capabilities are required.\nNFV is an important technology in 5G and its security is critical for the overall security of the 5G networks, especially because 5G networks are underpinning critical infrastructures.\nBackground\n supports EU member states with the ensuring that 5G networks are deployed securely.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 287/67 (IT) Tuesday, August 13, 2024. FreeBSD has released a security update to address a critical vulnerability in OpenSSH, which could be exploited by attackers to remotely execute code with root privileges. The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2024-7589 and has a CVSS score of 7.4, indicating high severity. This vulnerability is related to signal handling in sshd (8) that may invoke unsafe logging functionality when a client fails to authenticate within the configured LoginGraceTime, which is typically 120 seconds. This process runs with root privileges, creating a risk that attackers could execute remote code. FreeBSD recommends users update OpenSSH to a supported version and restart sshd immediately to mitigate this threat. If updating is not feasible, users can reduce the risk by setting LoginGraceTime to 0 in the sshd_config file. While this increases the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, it will prevent remote code execution.  </br><br>- Source: Thai-CERT<br>- URL: <a href='https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/08/13/freebsd-%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%81%e0%b9%81%e0%b8%9e%e0%b8%97%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%8c%e0%b8%94%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%a7%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%aa%e0%b8%b3%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%9a%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad/'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 1]

Blinding in Proxied Federation </br><br>- Content: While some proxy structures — typically those that exist primarily to simplify integration — may not offer additional subscriber privacy protection, others offer varying levels of privacy to the subscriber through a range of blinding technologies. Privacy policies may dictate appropriate use of the subscriber attributes and authentication transaction data (e.g., identities of the ultimate IdP and RP) by the IdP, RP, and the federation proxy.Technical means such as blinding can increase effectiveness of these policies by making the data more difficult to obtain. A proxy-based system has three parties, and the proxy can be used to hide information from one or more of the parties, including itself. In a double-blind proxy, the IdP and RP do not know each other’s identities, and their relationship is only with the proxy. In a triple-blind proxy, the proxy additionally does not have insight into the data being passed through it. As the level of blinding increases, the technical and operational implementation complexity may increase. Since proxies need to map transactions to the appropriate parties on either side as well as manage the keys for all parties in the transaction, fully triple-blind proxies are very difficult to implement in practice.Even with the use of blinding technologies, a blinded party may still infer protected subscriber information through released attribute data or metadata, such as by analysis of timestamps, attribute bundle sizes, or attribute signer information. The IdP could consider additional privacy-enhancing approaches to reduce the risk of revealing identifying information of the entities participating in the federation.The following table illustrates a spectrum of blinding implementations used in proxied federation. This table is intended to be illustrative, and is neither comprehensive nor technology-specific.\n\nTable 4.

Usability Considerations, Subsection: 8.2 Pre-Enrollment Preparation </br><br>- Content: This section describes an effective approach to facilitate sufficient pre-enrollment preparation so users can avoid challenging, frustrating enrollment sessions. Ensuring that users are as prepared as possible for their enrollment sessions is critical to the overall success and usability of the identity proofing and enrollment process.\n\nSuch preparation is only possible if users receive the necessary information (e.g., the required documentation) in a usable format in an appropriate timeframe. This includes making users aware of exactly what identity evidence will be required. Users do not need to know anything about IALs or whether the identity evidence required is scored as “fair,” “strong,” or “superior,” whereas organizations need to know what IAL is required for access to a particular system.\n\nTo ensure users are equipped to make informed decisions about whether to proceed with the enrollment process, and what will be needed for their session, provide users:\n\n    - Information about the entire process, such as what to expect in each step.\nClear explanations of the expected timeframes to allow users to plan accordingly.\n    - Explanation of the need for — and benefits of — identity proofing to allow users to understand the value proposition.\n\n    - Identity evidence requirements for the intended IAL and a list of acceptable evidence documents, with information about how they will be validated.\n\n    - If there is an enrollment fee and, if so, the amount and acceptable forms of payment. Offering a variety of acceptable forms of payment allows users to choose their preferred payment operation.\n\n    - Information on whether the user’s enrollment session will be in-person or in-person over remote channels, and whether a user can choose. Only provide information relevant to the allowable session option(s).\n        o Information on the location(s), whether a user can choose their preferred location, and necessary logistical information for in-person or in-person over remote channels session. Note that users may be reluctant to bring identity evidence to certain public places (a supermarket versus a bank), as it increases exposure to loss or theft.\n        o Information on the technical requirements (e.g., requirements for internet access) for remote sessions.\n        o An option to set an appointment for in-person or in-person over remote channels identity proofing sessions to minimize wait times. If walk-ins are allowed, make it clear to users that their wait times may be greater without an appointment.\n            * Provide clear instructions for setting up an enrollment session appointment, reminders, and how to reschedule existing appointments.\n            * Offer appointment reminders and allow users to specify their preferred appointment reminder method(s) (e.g., postal mail, voicemail, email, text message). Users need information such as the date, time, and location, and a description of the required identity evidence.\n    - Information on the allowed and required identity evidence and attributes, whether each piece is voluntary or mandatory, and the consequences for not providing the complete set of identity evidence. Users need to know the specific combinations of identity evidence, including requirements specific to a piece of identity evidence (e.g., a raised seal on a birth certificate). This is especially important due to potential difficulties procuring the necessary identity evidence.\n        o Where possible, implement tools to make it easier to obtain the necessary identity evidence.\n        o Inform users of any special requirements for minors or people with unique needs. For example, provide users with the information on whether applicant reference and/or trusted referee processes are available and the information necessary to use those processes (see Sec. 3.1.13).\n        o If forms are required:\n            * Provide fillable forms before and at the enrollment session. Do not require users to have access to a printer.\n            * Minimize the amount of information that users must enter on a form, as users are easily frustrated and more error-prone with longer forms.

However, they may pose a completely different type of risk to drivers, passengers and pedestrians.\nAutonomous vehicles use artificial intelligence systems, which employ machine-learning techniques to collect, analyse and transfer data, in order to make decisions that in conventional cars are taken by humans. These systems, like all IT systems, are vulnerable to attacks that could compromise the proper functioning of the vehicle.\nA\nnew report\nby  and JRC sheds light on the cybersecurity risks linked to the uptake of AI in autonomous vehicles, and provides recommendations to mitigate them.\n“When an insecure autonomous vehicle crosses the border of an EU Member State, so do its vulnerabilities. Security should not come as an afterthought, but should instead be a prerequisite for the trustworthy and reliable deployment of vehicles on Europe’s roads,”\nsaid EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director\nJuhan Lepassaar\n.\n“\nIt is important that European regulations ensure that the benefits of autonomous driving will not be counterbalanced by safety risks. To support decision-making at EU level, our report aims to increase the understanding of the AI techniques used for autonomous driving as well as the cybersecurity risks connected to them, so that measures can be taken to ensure AI security in autonomous driving\n,” said JRC Director-General\nStephen Quest\n.\nVulnerabilities of AI in autonomous vehicles\nThe AI systems of an autonomous vehicle are working non-stop to recognise traffic signs and road markings, to detect vehicles, estimate their speed, to plan the path ahead. Apart from unintentional threats, such as sudden malfunctions, these systems are vulnerable to intentional attacks that have the specific aim to interfere with the AI system and to disrupt safety-critical functions.\nAdding paint on the road to misguide the navigation, or stickers on a stop sign to prevent its recognition are examples of such attacks. These alterations can lead to the AI system wrongly classifying objects, and subsequently to the autonomous vehicle behaving in a way that could be dangerous.\nRecommendations for more secure AI in autonomous vehicles\nIn order to improve the AI security in autonomous vehicles, the report contains several recommendations, one of which is that security assessments of AI components are performed regularly throughout their lifecycle. This systematic validation of AI models and data is essential to ensure that the vehicle always behaves correctly when faced with unexpected situations or malicious attacks.\nAnother recommendation is that continuous risk assessment processes supported by threat intelligence could enable the identification of potential AI risks and emerging threats related to the uptake of AI in autonomous driving. Proper AI security policies and an AI security culture should govern the entire supply chain for automotive.\nThe automotive industry should embrace a\nsecurity by design\napproach for the development and deployment of AI functionalities, where cybersecurity becomes the central element of digital design from the beginning. Finally, it is important that the automotive sector increas­es its level of preparedness and reinforces its inci­dent response capabilities to handle emerging cy­bersecurity issues connected to AI.\nFurther Information\n-JRC Report - Cybersecurity Challenges in the Uptake of Artificial Intelligence in Autonomous Driving\n Threat Landscape on Artificial Intelligence – 2020 Report\n Good Practices for Security of Smart Cars – 2019 Report\nCybersecurity and Resilience of Smart Cars – 2016 Report\nContacts\nFor questions related to the press and interviews, please contact:\npress(at).europa.eu\nJRC-PRESS(at)ec.europa.eu </br><br>- Source: ENISA<br>- URL: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cybersecurity-challenges-in-the-uptake-of-artificial-intelligence-in-autonomous-driving'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Usability Considerations </br><br>- Content: *This section is informative*.\n\nThis section is intended to raise implementers’ awareness of the usability considerations associated with enrollment and identity proofing (for usability considerations for typical authenticator usage and intermittent events, see [SP 800-63B,](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b) Section 10.\n\n[ISO/IEC 9241-11](#page46) defines usability as the “extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.” This definition focuses on users, goals, and context of use as the necessary elements for achieving effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. A holistic approach considering these key elements is necessary to achieve usability.\n\nThe overarching goal of usability for enrollment and identity proofing is to promote a smooth, positive enrollment process for users by minimizing user burden (e.g., time and frustration) and enrollment friction (e.g., the number of steps to complete and amount of information to track). To achieve this goal, organizations have to first familiarize themselves with their users.\n\nThe enrollment and identity proofing process sets the stage for a user’s interactions with a given CSP and the online services that the user will access; as negative first impressions can influence user perception of subsequent interactions, organizations need to promote a positive user experience throughout the process.\n\nUsability cannot be achieved in a piecemeal manner. Performing a usability evaluation on the enrollment and identity proofing process is critical. It is important to conduct usability evaluation with representative users, realistic goals and tasks, and appropriate contexts of use. The enrollment and identity proofing process should be designed and implemented so it is easy for users to do the right thing, hard to do the wrong thing, and easy to recover when the wrong thing happens.\n\nFrom the user’s perspective, the three main steps of enrollment and identity proofing are pre-enrollment preparation, the enrollment and proofing session, and post-enrollment actions. These steps may occur in a single session or there could be significant time elapsed between each one (e.g., days or weeks).\n\nGeneral and step-specific usability considerations are described in sub-sections below.\n\n**ASSUMPTIONS**\n\nIn this section, the term “users” means “applicants” or “subscribers.”\n\nGuidelines and considerations are described from the users’ perspective.\n\nAccessibility differs from usability and is out of scope for this document.

It also contributed towards building strong internal and external communication channels that are of significant importance in times of a cybersecurity crisis. In addition, it raised cybersecurity awareness at the corporate level, underscoring the significance of cybersecurity preparedness.\nCyber Europe 2024 gathered approximately 5.000 participants coming from different sectors, such as energy, digital infrastructure and public administration, EU-level cybersecurity networks, as well as EU institutions, bodies, and agencies. During this year’s edition, around 28.000 injects carried the exercise forward and stepped up the quality of the scenario.\nCompared to previous years, this after action report places greater emphasis on meaningful insights from participants and identifies potential areas of improvement, incorporating lessons identified and actionable recommendations. The report provides a comprehensive view of the exercise's effectiveness and highlights ways for enhancement in future exercises.\nOverall, both players and planners of Cyber Europe 2024 reported a high level of satisfaction with the exercise. More than 90% of players expressed enhanced readiness and preparedness to handle cybersecurity incidents, viewing the exercise as an opportunity to test their cybersecurity capabilities and procedures. With regards to crisis management, incident reporting processes were successfully deployed while securing business continuity across sectors.\nCyber Europe 2024 had also specific aims for the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) Network and the European Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (EU-CyCLONe). These included ensuring the adequacy of EU-level operational cooperation and escalation mechanisms during cybersecurity crises and ensuring the existence, adequacy, effectiveness, and speed of communication channels and SOPs between CNW (CSIRTs Network), and EU-CyCLONe. An additional aim was to assess the completeness, quality, and timeliness of information exchange.\nIn relation to the areas that could be further improved, it was observed that greater emphasis should be placed on cross-border sectorial coordination and the allocation of sufficient resources to support these efforts. Findings of the report also suggest that despite efficient collaboration between energy operators and national authorities in incident reporting, there are still limitations in indicating the cross-border impact of a potential incident. It  underlined that a regional approach is crucial to address connection and collaboration between national cybersecurity authorities and operators across Member States during multi-state incidents.\nIn the context of the exercise, identified lessons were used to develop recommendations that will be taken into consideration for the preparation of the next Cyber Europe exercise. Following-up on recommendations for improvements made in previous years, not only leads to concrete improvements but also demonstrates the valuable impact of the Cyber Europe as an initiative.\nAbout Cyber Europe 2024\nCyber Europe 2024 exercise focused on a scenario featuring cyber threats targeting the EU energy infrastructure deriving from friction caused by geopolitical tension between the European Union and a fictitious foreign nation. With propaganda swaying public opinion and concerns about APTs (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups exploiting vulnerabilities, the energy sector became a prime target. In the effort to prevent a large-scale attack threatening the European economy and destabilising political balance, stakeholders had to swiftly coordinate their actions and response. The two-day event simulated a series of large-scale cyber incidents where players were called on to practice their coordination and crisis management skills to tackle challenges and ensure business continuity in the face of a crisis.\nAfter Action Report\nCyber Europe tests the EU Cyber Preparedness in the Energy Sector | \nCyber Europe | \nTrainings and exercises |  </br><br>- Source: ENISA<br>- URL: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/cyber-europe-2024-unveiling-key-insights-from-the-cyber-exercise-that-tested-the-cybersecurity-of-eus-energy-sector'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

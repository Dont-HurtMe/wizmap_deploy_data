The report builds upon the ’ good practice guide on vulnerability disclosure’ published in 2016.\nThe Executive Director of  Udo Helmbrecht commented: “Economics is a key driver of modern security and economic considerations often determine the decision of approaches to be taken when resolving issues. This report perfectly illustrates this fact and provides valuable insight into why different actors behave as they do in the vulnerability disclosure space.”\nVulnerability disclosure refers to the process of identifying, reporting and patching weaknesses of software, hardware or service that can be exploited. The different actors within a vulnerability disclosure process are subject to a range of economic considerations and incentives that may influence their behaviour.\nThese economic aspects of vulnerability disclosure are often overlooked and poorly understood, but may help explain why some vulnerabilities are disclosed responsibly while others are not.

In Work Stream 1 for example, which is concerned with understanding the evolving threat environment and defining suitable mitigation strategies, the areas of application are Critical Infrastructure and Trust Infrastructure. This focus on core issues will allow the Agency to exploit synergies between the different activities that constitute the work programme as a whole and is expected to provide stakeholders with a more holistic view of the state of Network and Information Security  in these areas.\nAs in previous years,  recognises the need to avoid duplication of work and has sought to define activities that are complementary to those undertaken by other European bodies or by other stakeholder communities in general.\nMore information:\n Work Programme 2013 URL: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-publishes-work-programme-2013", "2012", 0]

The report is targeted primarily at e-communication providers, and at a second level, to National Regulatory Authorities as members of ’s Article 13a Experts Group.\nMost of the providers, report a very good level of using  recommendations on security requirements, while virtually all providers have deployed a good level of basic security controls. In some security domains, the level of maturity reported, is high as well as the sophistication of implemented controls.\nIt is important that providers of electronic communications take the appropriate measures to address major security concerns. A key conclusion seems to be that while all IT security basics are covered, the achievement of the next level of maturity is impeded mostly by lack of sustainability mechanisms, i.e. repeatable processes and the regularly maintained documentation.\nThe main recommendation for the providers - based on the reported deployment of security measures - is to pay additional attention to sustainability and efficiency.

Ensure that governance aspects are derived from business processes and protection requirements, and are defined before dealing with technology.\n2. End-user involvement can effectively mitigate risks. Awareness-raising on COIT programmes is highly effective for the enforcement of security policies.\n3. Periodic risk assessment on COIT programmes should be undertaken to ensure that security policies remain compatible with evolving technologies.\n4. Keep in mind that encryption complements but does not replace strategic risk management within a COIT programme.\n5. Perform small steps initially and proceed with more complex policies when sufficient experience has been gained.\n6.

The recent\n‘Flamer’\nspyware virus that targeted PCs in a number of Middle Eastern countries shows the international nature of the threat, and highlights the fact that attackers are developing highly specialised malware.

Working with organisations such as ISACA provides  with a further opportunity to share good practice and support improved network and information security for all.”\nProfessor Helmbrecht will be participating as a panellist with Mr Marc Vael of ISACA and a representative from NIST – The US National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Limitations and inherent constraints are presented with recommendations for their mitigation.\nThe study, targeted at data protection authorities, policy makers, regulaltors, engineers and researchers, offers an insight into the technological aspect of the current state of the art. It presents the challenges and limitations of by-design principles for privacy and data protection, acts as a reference guide, and intends to improve the effectiveness of future policy in the area.\nThe main challenges identified in the report are two fold:\nExisting policy doesn’t offer a guarantee for compliance with privacy by design. New policy should give incentives for adopting privacy by design.\nNew standards for electronic communication need to consider privacy and data protection, while privacy and data protection-ignorant standards should be out-phased.\nFurthermore, privacy by design needs to be linked with the practice taking usability into account.\nFor the full report:\nPrivacy and Data Protection by Design - from policy to engineering\nBackground:\nPrivacy constitutes a core value of individuals and democratic societies.

It is present nowadays at the basis of server and desktop infrastructures, cloud computing, networking, and containerization.\nVirtualized environments are pervasively adopted and therefore increasingly becoming targets of cyber-attacks. More and more elaborated and specialized attacks are currently devised to exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses at the virtualization layer. The recent and widespread adoption of virtualization technologies has changed the traditional view of ICT, as virtualization can provide a dramatic increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of complex organizations and communities. It is also expected to constitute an important technological pillar of a thriving data-driven economy and the European single digital market.\nHowever, virtualization technologies bear a number of different security risks, some of them shared with traditional computing environments including issues affecting operating systems, communication protocols, and applications, which can be even exacerbated by the presence of virtualized components, producing a greater security impact.  On the other side, virtualization also introduces a number of specific security issues requiring ad hoc solutions.\nFull report\nis available\nonline\nFor interviews and press enquiries\nplease contact\npress@.europa.eu\nTel\n. +30 2814409576 URL: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-study-on-the-security-aspects-of-virtualization", "2017", 0]

Alternatively, a malicious application with escalation privileges may utilize those privileges to gain access to network traffic.   \nSpecific to Android devices, adversary-in-the-disk is a type of AiTM attack where adversaries monitor and manipulate data that is exchanged between applications and external storage.\n To accomplish this, a malicious application firsts requests for access to multimedia files on the device (\n and \n), then the application reads data on the device and/or writes malware to the device. Though the request for access is common, when used maliciously, adversaries may access files and other sensitive data due to abusing the permission. Multiple applications were shown to be vulnerable against this attack; however, scrutiny of permissions and input validations may mitigate this attack.    \nOutside of a mobile device, adversaries may be able to capture traffic by employing a rogue base station or Wi-Fi access point. These devices will allow adversaries to capture network traffic after it has left the device, while it is flowing to its destination. On a local network, enterprise techniques could be used, such as \n or \n.  \nIf applications properly encrypt their network traffic, sensitive data may not be accessible to adversaries, depending on the point of capture.

A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.\nDifferent ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.\n With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed. Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.\nACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists. When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets.

This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.\nAnother variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS. The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections. If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm.

Researchers from the security firm c/side found that the malware uses the domain wp3[.]xyz to send data to the attacker's server. After successfully compromising a system, the malicious script creates an account named \"wpx_admin\" with a password specified in the code. It then installs a plugin named plugin.php, which collects data such as administrator accounts and logs, and sends the data disguised as image requests to evade security detection.  C/side states that the malware also includes steps to verify the success of the attack, such as checking whether the account and plugin have been created and activated, to systematically track the status of the attack. For prevention, c/side recommends blocking the wp3[.]xyz domain using firewalls and security tools, checking administrator accounts and installed plugins for unusual activity, and adding CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection using short-lived server-side tokens.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 402/67 (IT) Wednesday, November 13, 2024. Kaspersky researchers discovered a new type of ransomware called Ymir being used in attacks alongside the RustyStealer malware, a data-stealing program that infiltrates victim systems before deploying the ransomware.  Ymir attacks networks containing sensitive information, with RustyStealer utilizing techniques to collect credentials and gain system access through privileged accounts. Once installed, Ymir encrypts system files and creates a ransom note in a PDF file to coerce payment.  It also modifies Windows settings to display warning messages on the login screen to further pressure victims into complying with the hackers' demands.  Ymir ransomware operates stealthily by running in memory and uses ChaCha20 encryption, an advanced encryption algorithm, to encrypt data, making decryption difficult.  The malware also scans the system for signs of PowerShell and deletes itself to avoid detection in its final stages. Currently, no data leak site associated with Ymir has been found, suggesting that the attackers may be in the early stages of victim data collection.  If this ransomware evolves to include data exfiltration capabilities, it could become an even more dangerous threat.

The Canadian government has ordered TikTok, owned by ByteDance in China, to cease operations in the country.  The decision is stated to be the result of a national security risk assessment.  The review was conducted by Canada’s security and intelligence community. The government emphasized that it will not restrict access to TikTok for the general Canadian public, but advised citizens to assess the potential risks of using the social media app.  François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, stated that the government wants citizens to be aware of the risks of using social media platforms, particularly in terms of data management and security related to foreign countries. TikTok has been banned on government devices since February 2023.  TikTok responded that closing the office in Canada will result in hundreds of employees being laid off.  The company intends to challenge this order in court.  In a statement, ByteDance confirmed that no user data will be shared with the Chinese government. However, concerns remain that TikTok may be forced to hand over user data. This has resulted in the U.S. enacting a law requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok by January 2025 or face a ban in the country.

Researchers from ETH Zurich discovered serious encryption problems in cloud storage platforms using end-to-end encryption (E2EE), which could lead to the leakage of sensitive user data.  This report indicates that 5 major providers, such as Sync, pCloud, Icedrive, Seafile, and Tresorit, all have vulnerabilities found in their cloud storage processes. Researchers Jonas Hofmann and Kien Tuong Truong explained that \"malicious servers could be used to interfere with or modify file data, including accessing user data in plain text.\"  The vulnerabilities found involve various attack methods such as file insertion, metadata modification, and authentication bypass, impacting the confidentiality and security of user data. Furthermore, these attacks do not require advanced cryptographic skills, making them easy to execute even by attackers with limited resources.  Sync, pCloud, Seafile, and Tresorit have acknowledged the report and are working on fixes. Icedrive, however, has chosen not to take action, despite the disclosure in late April 2024.

Cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies has revealed phishing attacks attempting to exploit a vulnerability in the open-source webmail software Roundcube. Although Roundcube is not the most popular software, many government agencies still use it, making it a prime target for hackers. The attack begins with an email that appears to have no content, but contains hidden JavaScript code that allows hackers to access sensitive information. It exploits the vulnerability CVE-2024-37383, a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) security issue. Attackers can trick victims into opening a specially crafted email, causing JavaScript code to run that can access sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. This information is then sent to a server controlled by the hackers, hosted on Cloudflare. Currently, it is not clear who is behind the attacks, but Positive Technologies points out that hacker groups APT28, Winter Vivern, and TAG-70 have previously used similar vulnerabilities in Roundcube.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 326/67 (IT) Tuesday, September 17, 2024. Researchers from Aqua Security discovered new malware called \"Hadooken,\" which attacks WebLogic servers.  The malware's name comes from an attack move in the game Street Fighter.  Hadooken's capabilities include installing cryptocurrency mining software (cryptominer) and deploying Tsunami malware, which can be used for later system breaches.  This attack targets WebLogic servers, developed by Oracle and often used in large organizations. Attackers gain access to the servers through weak passwords. They then use shell scripts and Python to download and install the malware on the server, while also attempting to hide traces of the attack. Researchers found that the Hadooken malware was downloaded from two IP addresses: 89.185.85.102 (still active), registered in Germany, and 185.174.136.204 (no longer active), registered in Russia.  The still-active IP has been linked to the TeamTNT and Gang 8220 groups. However, researchers do not yet have enough evidence to confirm the source of this attack.  Searching for additional information through Shodan revealed more than 230,000 WebLogic servers connected to the internet. Although most are well-protected, some may be vulnerable to attack.  Researchers recommend that administrators monitor and update their software to prevent future attacks.

Cybersecurity researchers recommend users immediately upgrade Adobe Acrobat Reader and Adobe Acrobat after the discovery of a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-41869) which could be exploited to execute remote code. This vulnerability was discovered through the EXPMON platform and a publicly released Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit.  By opening a specially crafted PDF file, attackers can leverage this vulnerability to access memory and execute malicious code.  The vulnerability is related to a \"Use-After-Free\" error, where the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unexpected behavior such as crashes or freezes.  If attackers manage to inject malicious code into that memory location, they can easily execute it on the target device. Although a security update was released in August, it reportedly did not fully address the issue. Users who updated to the new version still experienced application crashes when clicking or closing a specific dialog box. However, Adobe has since released the latest update that fixes this flaw.

Law enforcement agencies from multiple countries have cooperated in the arrest and extradition of Belarusian and Ukrainian nationals believed to be involved with a Russian-speaking cybercrime group.  The operation was coordinated by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA). One of those arrested is Maksim Silnikau, 38, who used the online alias “JP Morgan.” He was extradited from Poland to the United States in August 2024 to face charges related to international computer hacking and wire fraud.  The group was involved in the development and distribution of ransomware such as Reveton and the Angler Exploit Kit, which affected hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide.  Reveton, in particular, launched in 2011, is known as one of the first ransomware-as-a-service operations and reportedly earned the group as much as $400,000 per month.  Silnikau is also charged in connection with operating the Ransom Cartel ransomware, starting in May 2021, and using hidden websites to track and control ransomware attacks. If convicted on all counts, Silnikau could face more than 50 years in prison. This arrest is the result of international cooperation and represents a significant step in the fight against complex transnational cybercrime.

The group started by publishing data stolen by the LockBit ransomware group but has since evolved into an international ransomware gang targeting small to medium-sized businesses, including organizations across multiple sectors worldwide.  The FBI collaborated with law enforcement agencies from several countries to disrupt the group's infrastructure. Servers were shut down in the US, UK, and Germany, as well as criminal domains used in the attacks.  Radar/Dispossessor employs sophisticated attack methods, exploiting vulnerabilities and easily guessed passwords to access victims' systems. They then encrypt data and extort victims for ransom.  The criminals also contact victims' employees directly via email or phone to increase pressure to pay the ransom.

FreeBSD has released a security update to address a critical vulnerability in OpenSSH, which could be exploited by attackers to remotely execute code with root privileges. The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2024-7589 and has a CVSS score of 7.4, indicating high severity. This vulnerability is related to signal handling in sshd (8) that may invoke unsafe logging functionality when a client fails to authenticate within the configured LoginGraceTime, which is typically 120 seconds. This process runs with root privileges, creating a risk that attackers could execute remote code. FreeBSD recommends users update OpenSSH to a supported version and restart sshd immediately to mitigate this threat. If updating is not feasible, users can reduce the risk by setting LoginGraceTime to 0 in the sshd_config file. While this increases the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, it will prevent remote code execution.

On Monday, Google announced the cancellation of its plan to phase out third-party cookies in the Chrome web browser, which began more than 4 years ago under the Privacy Sandbox project. This is in response to numerous privacy concerns. Anthony Chavez, Vice President at Google, said the company will launch a new experience in Chrome that allows users to choose to use cookies as needed and can change that option at any time.  Google is consulting with regulators and will collaborate with the industry in implementing this change.  Although browsers like Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox have not supported third-party cookies since early 2020, Google continues to face difficulties in doing so due to its significant role in the online advertising market.  Efforts to balance privacy and ad support have met with intense scrutiny from regulators and privacy advocates.  This change comes just months after Google announced its plan to phase out third-party cookies again, which has been postponed several times due to concerns about fair competition in the digital advertising market. This cancellation reflects the challenge of getting industry consensus on a single solution for managing privacy on the internet.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 202/67 (IT) Friday, June 7, 2024. In early May 2024, German media Zeit Online revealed that threat actors exploited a vulnerability in the German government's Cisco Webex software to access critical internal meetings. In March, German authorities admitted to the hacking of military meetings related to military support for Ukraine, which is suspected to be the work of threat actors linked to Russia. Cisco issued an advisory in early May stating that it had discovered a vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings that allowed threat actors to access meeting data and metadata. Experts believe the vulnerability exploited was an insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), allowing threat actors to access meeting information such as topics and participants, as well as eavesdrop on sensitive meetings. Although the German government uses an internal version of Webex, some online meeting rooms of senior officials were not password-protected.  Cisco confirmed that the vulnerability has been fixed and a global fix was implemented on May 28, 2024. Cisco also informed affected customers that no other attempts to exploit this vulnerability were found and emphasized that the company will continue to monitor such activities and provide updates through regular channels.

Aleksanteri Kivimäki, a 26-year-old Finnish hacker, has been sentenced to more than six years in prison for hacking into the psychotherapy clinic of the Vastaamo Psychotherapy center, exposing the treatment records of tens of thousands of patients, and attempting to extort money from the clinic and its clients. The man was arrested in Paris in February 2023 and extradited to Finland for trial. The trial concluded in March 2024, with Kivimäki found guilty on several counts. Kivimäki has denied all charges and may appeal, according to his lawyer.  Prosecutors had sought a maximum sentence of seven years, given the nature of the crime.  Kivimäki has been involved in several criminal cases in the past, including being a member of the hacking groups Hack the Planet (HTP) and Lizard Squad. In 2013, investigators found malicious code on devices seized from Kivimäki that the HTP group used to attack more than 60,000 servers, exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion.

Website security company Sucuri warns that more than 39,000 websites are infected with a new family of malware that redirects website visitors to fraudulent domains and unwanted advertisements. The name Sign1 comes from the discovery of JavaScript malware in WordPress custom HTML widgets or within the Simple Custom CSS and JS WordPress plugin that attackers added to compromised websites. Using this method, hackers spread malware to websites without placing malicious code in server files, allowing the malware to go unnoticed for long periods, as it is common for security providers to scan website files for malware rather than checking databases. The injected code is responsible for changing the URL to be executed in the victim's browser every 10 minutes, but only if the visitor comes from major websites such as Facebook, Google, Instagram, and Yahoo. In the past six months, Sucuri has identified more than 39,000 websites infected with various forms of this malware, and recently more than 2,500 websites have been infected in the past two months.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 93/67 (IT) reported on Friday, March 8, 2024, that financial organizations in Vietnam have been targeted by a new cyber attacker group called Lotus Bane. This is part of a cyber attack first detected in March 2023. Group-IB said that this is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group, believed to have been active since 2022. The exact specifics of the attack patterns are still unknown. Group-IB explains that the techniques used by Lotus Bane overlap with OceanLotus, a Vietnamese threat group also known as APT32, Canvas Cyclone (formerly Bismuth), and Cobalt Kitty. This stems from the use of malware such as PIPEDANCE.  It is worth noting that PIPEDANCE was first documented by Elastic Security Labs in February 2023, linked to cyber attacks targeting an unnamed organization in Vietnam in late December 2022. The Lotus Bane group was involved in the attack, primarily targeting the banking sector in the APAC region. Although the attacks took place in Vietnam, their sophisticated methods indicate the potential for attacks on other countries within the APAC group.  Ongoing investigations may shed more light on their origins.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 87/67 (IT) Tuesday, March 5, 2024. Researchers from Consumer Reports (CR) have discovered serious vulnerabilities in wireless video doorbell products manufactured by Eken Group Ltd. from China under the brands EKEN and Tuck.  These are sold at major retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, Shein, and Sears.  The security flaws could allow malicious actors to view video from the devices or take complete control of them. Attackers can exploit the flaws to create accounts in the application and access the doorbell products by pairing them with other devices.  Malicious actors can then view images and lock out the device owners. Steve Blair, CR's privacy and security testing engineer, found at least 10 other similar-looking doorbell camera products sold under different brand names, all controlled through the same mobile app called Aiwit, owned by EKEN. Some major online retailers, such as Walmart, have removed the flawed products from their catalogs and offered refunds to customers who purchased the devices. However, EKEN smart wireless video doorbell devices are currently still being sold on Amazon.

Two taxi drivers accused of participating in a cyberattack scheme targeting the taxi dispatch system at John F. Kennedy International Airport were sentenced to prison by a US court on Monday.  The individuals, Daniel Abayev, was sentenced to 4 years and Peter Leyman to 2 years, a $160,000 fine, and nearly $3.5 million in restitution. Both are US citizens residing in New York. They pleaded guilty in October 2023 to conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, working with two Russians, Aleksandr Derebenetc and Kirill Shipulin, from at least September 2019 to September 2021.  They paid Russian hackers to breach the JFK Airport taxi dispatch system to manipulate the taxi queue, prioritizing drivers who paid Abayev and Leyman. At JFK, taxis wait in a holding lot before being dispatched to terminals based on arrival order, often waiting hours. The scheme allowed some drivers to skip the queue. Officials say up to 1,000 taxis per day used this method, paying $10 each time to jump the line.

Security researchers have released a new toolkit designed to help victims of Black Basta Ransomware. This toolkit can recover stolen files.  SR Labs Research revealed in a recent GitHub post that these tools exploit a weakness in Black Basta's encryption algorithm. Analysis indicates that files can be recovered, whether fully or partially, depending on the file size. Files smaller than 5,000 bytes cannot be recovered.  Files between 5,000 bytes and 1GB can be fully recovered. For files larger than 1GB, the first 5,000 bytes will be lost, but the rest can be recovered.  The tool works when Black Basta encrypts files with only zeros, which is why it only works with larger files. However, the decryption tool will only work with Black Basta Ransomware used in attacks around April 2023. Black Basta is one of the most successful ransomware-as-a-service operations, generating over US$100 million since April 2022.

A fix was released on July 25th with version 8.8.15 Patch 41 of the software, leaving almost a month for the issue to be exploited.  The vulnerability is an XSS (cross-site scripting) issue in the Zimbra Classic Web Client.  According to Google's threat analysts, attackers exploited systems belonging to governments in Greece, Moldova, Tunisia, Vietnam, and Pakistan to steal email data, user credentials, and authentication tokens. Google's report did not reveal many details about the attackers, but warned about the importance of timely updates even for moderate severity vulnerabilities, as attackers can use them for further attacks.  The exploitation of CVE-2023-37580 is one of several examples of XXS vulnerabilities used to target mail servers, such as CVE-2022-24682 and CVE-2023-5631 affecting Zimbra and Roundcube.

Some groups no longer have plans for such attacks, and others have shifted their focus to targets outside of Israel. Research by Security Scorecard, published this month, found that several Hacktivist groups had planned attacks or identified targets, but many have gone silent or shifted to selling attack services. Dark Storm, a pro-Palestinian group, posted claims on a Dark Web forum in August 2023 that it would \"attack Israeli infrastructure.\" In early October, it claimed to be preparing attacks on Israel's European allies.  Several Hacktivist groups threatened disruptive attacks against Israeli and Palestinian targets, while the SiegedSec group claimed responsibility for attacks on Israeli infrastructure and industrial control systems.  Furthermore, Solomon’s Ring, a Persian-speaking, pro-Palestinian hacktivist channel, has not claimed an attack since October 8, despite being active since October 2022 and claiming to have hacked and stolen data from Israeli data centers, though without evidence.

Kaspersky, in an analysis published last week, stated that \"The primary distribution method for Zanubis involves impersonating legitimate Android applications in Peru.  It then tricks users into enabling accessibility permissions and takes complete control of the device.\" Zanubis, originally documented in August 2022, is the latest addition to a long list of Android banking Trojans targeting the Latin American (LATAM) region. Targets include more than 40 banks and financial institutions in Peru. It is primarily known for abusing accessibility permissions on infected devices to display fake overlay screens on top of target apps in an attempt to steal credentials. It can also collect contact information, installed app lists, and system metadata. Kaspersky said it observed the latest Zanubis samples in April 2023, masquerading as the Peruvian customs and tax authority application, Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria (SUNAT).  Once installed, this allows Zanubis to perform keylogging or screen recording to steal sensitive information.

Attackers can also forge RocketMQ protocol content.  This vulnerability affects Apache RocketMQ versions 5.1.0 and earlier. Users should update to version 5.1.1. Apache's advisory was released in May, but CISA added the issue to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog after cybersecurity firm VulnCheck published technical details about the vulnerability.  CISA ordered federal agencies to patch this vulnerability by September 27, 2023. FCEB agencies must remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect against attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in the Catalog. Experts also recommend that private sector organizations review the Catalog and address vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.

BugProve, a provider of IoT firmware analysis platforms, has disclosed details of more than a dozen vulnerabilities found in security cameras made by Zavio, a Chinese company that has since shut down. However, the cameras are reportedly still in use in the United States and Europe.\n\nBecause Zavio is defunct, BugProve worked with CCTV Camera Pros, a major Zavio camera distributor in the US, to investigate the vulnerabilities and report them to the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) for public disclosure and CVE assignment. According to the companies, seven of the vulnerabilities can be exploited for unauthenticated remote code execution with root privileges. These flaws allow attackers to completely take over the targeted devices. IP cameras are often targeted by botnet herders and used in DDoS and other attacks. CISA has assigned only two CVE identifiers, CVE-2023-4249 and CVE-2023-3959, as the vulnerabilities stem from the same root cause.\n\nSince the affected Zavio cameras will not receive patches, users are advised to replace the devices in order to prevent becoming victims of malicious attacks.

This forced the hosting providers to shut down all systems, including customer websites and emails. Both Hosting CloudNordic and AzeroCloud brands belong to the same company. The attack occurred last Friday night, and the company stated it would not pay the ransom. The company is cooperating with security experts and has reported the incident to the police.  Due to the situation, both hosting providers recommend heavily impacted customers migrate to other providers, such as Powernet and Nordicway.  Danish media reported that the attack affected hundreds of Danish companies, which lost data stored in the cloud, including websites, email inboxes, and documents. Targeting hosting providers is a tactic used by ransomware groups in the past, as it causes significant damage and allows them to attack many victims in a single attack. This incident has resulted in numerous victims, putting immense pressure on the providers to pay the ransom to restore operations and avoid lawsuits from customers who lost data.

This is possible by the XOR-ing of an IV with the initial plaintext block so that every plaintext block in the chain is XOR'd with a different value before encryption.

The first is to generate the IV randomly. The second method is to encrypt a nonce with the same key and cipher to be used to encrypt the plaintext.

If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed.

This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.\nOrdered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.\nSticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.\nIn addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Implementation\nIf the application only requires communication with its own components, then the destination is always known, and an explicit intent could be used.\n URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/927.html", "2013", 1]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 402/67 (IT) Wednesday, November 13, 2024. Kaspersky researchers discovered a new type of ransomware called Ymir being used in attacks alongside the RustyStealer malware, a data-stealing program that infiltrates victim systems before deploying the ransomware.  Ymir attacks networks containing sensitive information, with RustyStealer utilizing techniques to collect credentials and gain system access through privileged accounts. Once installed, Ymir encrypts system files and creates a ransom note in a PDF file to coerce payment.  It also modifies Windows settings to display warning messages on the login screen to further pressure victims into complying with the hackers' demands.  Ymir ransomware operates stealthily by running in memory and uses ChaCha20 encryption, an advanced encryption algorithm, to encrypt data, making decryption difficult.  The malware also scans the system for signs of PowerShell and deletes itself to avoid detection in its final stages. Currently, no data leak site associated with Ymir has been found, suggesting that the attackers may be in the early stages of victim data collection.

The Ugandan government confirmed on Thursday that the country's central bank was hit by a cyberattack by financially motivated threat actors, resulting in a significant loss of funds. The attack is under investigation by the Criminal Investigations Directorate (CID) of the police and the Office of the Auditor General (OAG).  Henry Musasizi, the junior finance minister, revealed in parliament that some central bank accounts were hacked. However, the losses might not be as severe as reported in some media outlets. He added that the bank has undertaken a thorough account reconciliation and investigation into the incident. The Bank of Uganda indicated that the attack involved a threat actor group called “Waste,” believed to be operating from Southeast Asia. The group moved 62 billion Ugandan shillings (approximately $16.8 million) to foreign accounts in early November. According to local media reports, some of the money was transferred to accounts in Japan and the United Kingdom. Authorities in the UK were able to seize more than $7 million, although some had already been withdrawn. In Japan, the attackers reportedly received about $6 million.

In this new strategy, Russia's cyber units are starting to focus on Ukrainian military targets instead of focusing cyberattacks on strategic civilian critical infrastructure targets. Russian officials are specifically targeting military computers and mobile phones before the summer offensive to reclaim Ukrainian territory. This change in cyber strategy stems from a shift in priorities, according to a report by the Royal United Services Institute.  Initially, Russia focused on attacking civilian infrastructure in the region because it thought the war would end quickly. Dan Black, manager of cyber espionage analysis at Mandiant, a Google Cloud company, and author of the report, said, \"Moscow has rebalanced its overall operational concept to emphasize targets that can provide more direct and tangible battlefield advantages to conventional forces.”  Russia's new tactics include hacking devices used by the Ukrainian military, social engineering attacks to penetrate Ukrainian command and control systems, and hacking into webcams in population centers to search for Ukrainian military equipment.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/07/25/%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%aa%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%8b%e0%b8%b5%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%9b%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%9a%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%b8%e0%b8%97%e0%b8%98%e0%b9%8c%e0%b8%94%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%99/", "2024", 0]

Cybersecurity researcher Patrick Wardle has revealed the latest campaign by North Korean-backed hackers, known for scamming victims with fake job postings. This time, they're using a new version of the BeaverTail malware to trick macOS users into downloading a malicious version of Microtalk, a video call service.  Wardle explains in his report that the attackers lure victims into downloading a Microtalk update file infected with BeaverTail malware by asking them to participate in a job interview. \"Even though the fake website states 'you can start your next video chat with a single click, without downloading anything,' some users may not read all the details,\" Wardle said.  In addition to stealing data from victims' devices, BeaverTail malware can also load additional malware onto the system, including InvisibleFerret.  The report adds that North Korean hackers are skilled at targeting macOS users with social engineering attacks.

WinRAR, a file compression and archiving utility for Windows operating systems, was affected by a high-severity vulnerability, now patched, designated CVE-2023-40477 (CVSS score 7.8).  This vulnerability could allow remote code execution on a computer by opening a specially crafted RAR archive.  The vulnerability was reported to RARLAB by Zero Day Initiative researcher \"goodbyeselene\" on June 8, 2023, and could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a RARLAB WinRAR installation. User interaction is required for exploitation. Targets may be tricked into visiting malicious websites or opening malicious files.  The vulnerability is due to a lack of validation of user-supplied data, which can result in out-of-bounds memory access.  This allows attackers to execute code by exploiting this vulnerability.

Malicious modifications to NAT may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.\nNetwork devices such as routers and firewalls that connect multiple networks together may implement NAT during the process of passing packets between networks. When performing NAT, the network device will rewrite the source and/or destination addresses of the IP address header. Some network designs require NAT for the packets to cross the border device.  A typical example of this is environments where internal networks make use of non-Internet routable addresses.\nWhen an adversary gains control of a network boundary device, they can either leverage existing NAT configurations to send traffic between two separated networks, or they can implement NAT configurations of their own design.  In the case of network designs that require NAT to function, this enables the adversary to overcome inherent routing limitations that would normally prevent them from accessing protected systems behind the border device.  In the case of network designs that do not require NAT, address translation can be used by adversaries to obscure their activities, as changing the addresses of packets that traverse a network boundary device can make monitoring data transmissions more challenging for defenders.  \nAdversaries may use \n to change the operating system of a network device, implementing their own custom NAT mechanisms to further obscure their activities\n https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599/001/", "2020", 1]

Kaspersky, in an analysis published last week, stated that \"The primary distribution method for Zanubis involves impersonating legitimate Android applications in Peru.  It then tricks users into enabling accessibility permissions and takes complete control of the device.\" Zanubis, originally documented in August 2022, is the latest addition to a long list of Android banking Trojans targeting the Latin American (LATAM) region. Targets include more than 40 banks and financial institutions in Peru. It is primarily known for abusing accessibility permissions on infected devices to display fake overlay screens on top of target apps in an attempt to steal credentials. It can also collect contact information, installed app lists, and system metadata. Kaspersky said it observed the latest Zanubis samples in April 2023, masquerading as the Peruvian customs and tax authority application, Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria (SUNAT).  Once installed, this allows Zanubis to perform keylogging or screen recording to steal sensitive information.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2023/10/03/zanubis-%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%97%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%88%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%98%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%84%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%a3%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%99-android-%e0%b8%9b%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%95%e0%b8%b1/", "2023", 0]

The BlackSuit Ransomware group is behind the CDK Global IT system outage that significantly impacted car dealership operations across North America. According to multiple sources, one source told BleepingComputer that CDK is negotiating with the ransomware group to obtain a decryptor to prevent the leak of stolen data.  The negotiations came after a BlackSuit Ransomware attack forced CDK to shut down its IT systems and data centers to prevent the spread of the attack, including the car dealership platform. The company attempted to restore services on Wednesday but encountered a second cyber incident, forcing another complete shutdown of its IT systems. CDK is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider whose platform is used by car dealerships for all aspects of operations, including sales, finance, inventory, service, and other back-office tasks.

The attack utilizes sophisticated malware to achieve cyber espionage objectives. The TTC-CERT has named this campaign BangkokShell.\n\nOverall, the BangkokShell campaign leverages open-source projects to develop attack tools and employs various anti-detection measures such as Dynamic API Resolution, Indirect Calls, stackstrings, and multiple encryption types. The BangkokShell attack process begins with DLL Side-loading to load obfuscated shellcode into the process memory before deobfuscating it. It then uses Reflective Code Loading to load and execute the payload, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), without leaving any traces on the filesystem.  TTC-CERT refers to this payload as RahadRAT. Analysis reveals interesting self-protection mechanisms, including password authentication support and the use of the CRC-16/XMODEM algorithm to verify data exchanged between the malware and the Command and Control (C2) server.  It supports 14 C2 commands designed to control and collect data from the target computer before obfuscating it with the RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) algorithm and sending it to the C2.\n https://drive.google.com/file/d/14OdsocsRVK6osG3TLxyGSB0fJZaaS2fK/view", "2023", 0]

The Philippines' Department of National Defense warned of the risks of using AI-powered applications to create images of individuals and ordered its personnel to immediately cease using such apps.  On October 14, Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. issued an order to stop using AI-powered image generation applications and to exercise caution in sharing information online.  This is due to the Philippine forces' ongoing efforts to quell decades-long communist and Muslim insurgencies, and to protect its interests in the disputed South China Sea.  It is currently unclear whether the order was issued in response to a specific incident or to address potential attacks aimed at exploiting data collected by these AI-powered applications. However, the memo warns about applications used to create digital avatar profile pictures after users submit at least 10 pictures of themselves. The avatars can then mimic how users actually speak and move.  The order states that these AI-powered applications pose significant privacy and security risks, as they can be misused to create fake profiles that can lead to identity theft, social engineering, phishing attacks, and other malicious activities.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2023/10/24/%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%b2%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%82%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%87%e0%b8%9f%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%9b%e0%b8%9b%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%aa%e0%b9%8c%e0%b8%aa%e0%b8%b1%e0%b9%88/", "2023", 0]

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions. \n \nWhen initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods. \n https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0890", "2021", 1]

Education should bring a stronger awareness about the need for security in products, both from the supplier side and the customer. Similarly, a lot of EU companies invest in IoT as a business enabler, however they don’t invest in security. In addition, security as we know it does not apply to the IoT environment, hence new frameworks are required to analyse risks” said Paulo Empadinhas.\n through its work, supports EU Member States in implementing the requirements of the NIS Directive, and initiatives such as the eIDAS, GDPR, which stimulate trust across different stakeholders and support industry policy in cybersecurity. Furthermore,  encourages the use of standardisation - a main pillar in creating the EU single market – which helps support market-based competition, removes market barriers and helps ensure interoperability.\nThe conference is the European extension of the Annual Security Conference taking place in Las Vegas (USA) for over a decade gathering participants from academia, government and industry to look into ‘the future of cybersecurity’.\nFor more @EuropeanSeC2015  #iseg, Source: ENISA, URL: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/discussing-the-impact-of-cybersecurity-in-dsm-and-eu-growth", "2016", 0]

The report aims to bridge the gap between the legal framework and the available technological implementation measures. It provides an inventory of the existing approaches and privacy design strategies, and the technical building blocks of various degree of maturity from research and development. Limitations and inherent constraints are presented with recommendations for their mitigation.\nThe study, targeted at data protection authorities, policy makers, regulaltors, engineers and researchers, offers an insight into the technological aspect of the current state of the art. It presents the challenges and limitations of by-design principles for privacy and data protection, acts as a reference guide, and intends to improve the effectiveness of future policy in the area.\nThe main challenges identified in the report are two fold:\nExisting policy doesn’t offer a guarantee for compliance with privacy by design. New policy should give incentives for adopting privacy by design.\nNew standards for electronic communication need to consider privacy and data protection, while privacy and data protection-ignorant standards should be out-phased.\nFurthermore, privacy by design needs to be linked with the practice taking usability into account.\nFor the full report:\nPrivacy and Data Protection by Design - from policy to engineering\nBackground:\nPrivacy constitutes a core value of individuals and democratic societies. Decades of debate have gone into the manner of embedding these values and legal obligations into systems, preferably from the beginning of the design process.

With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token. \nAdversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID.

It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS). If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception.

In this scenario, adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services.\n These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise. As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with the target or get the target's interest in some way. Adversaries will create fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities. Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and software that's running in an environment. The adversary can then send malicious links or attachments through these services.\nA common example is to build rapport with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail service that the target uses on their work computer. This allows an adversary to bypass some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more likely to open the file since it's something they were expecting. If the payload doesn't work as expected, the adversary can continue normal communications and troubleshoot with the target on how to get it working., \n, Source: MITRE, URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/003/", "2020", 1]

In the case of network designs that do not require NAT, address translation can be used by adversaries to obscure their activities, as changing the addresses of packets that traverse a network boundary device can make monitoring data transmissions more challenging for defenders.  \nAdversaries may use \n to change the operating system of a network device, implementing their own custom NAT mechanisms to further obscure their activities, \n, Source: MITRE, URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599/001/", "2020", 1]

A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.\nDifferent ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.\n With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed. Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.\nACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists. When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets.

This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.\nAnother variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS. The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections. If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm.

Researchers from the security firm c/side found that the malware uses the domain wp3[.]xyz to send data to the attacker's server. After successfully compromising a system, the malicious script creates an account named \"wpx_admin\" with a password specified in the code.

A high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2024-43405) with a CVSS score of 7.4 has been identified in Nuclei, an open-source vulnerability scanner.  This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass signature verification and inject malicious code into templates.  The Wiz team reported that the vulnerability stems from differing newline character handling between signature verification and YAML parser data conversion, enabling attackers to insert malicious content while maintaining valid signatures in the normal section.\n\nNuclei supports various protocols, including HTTP, TCP, DNS, and Code, which can execute code on the operating system.  Using unsafe templates could lead to system compromise.  Wiz's report demonstrates that the \"Code\" protocol can be used to extract sensitive information from target systems if weaponized with malicious code.\n\nThis vulnerability affects Nuclei versions 3.0.0 and later and has been patched in version v3.3.2.  Users should verify templates before use to prevent malicious code injection.  Caution should be exercised when allowing users to modify or upload templates in shared systems to avoid the risk of attacks that could lead to unauthorized command execution, data theft, or system control.\n\n, Source: Thai-CERT, URL: https://www.thaicert.or.th/2025/01/07/%e0%b8%9e%e0%b8%9a%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%87%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a7%e0%b9%88-nuclei-%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%aa%e0%b8%b5%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%87%e0%b8%96%e0%b8%b9%e0%b8%81%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%88/", "2025", 0]

GitLab has released an update to address a Critical vulnerability affecting the Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). This is a SAML authentication bypass, tracked as CVE-2024-45409, with a CVSS score of 10. The vulnerability stems from an issue in GitLab's OmniAuth-SAML and Ruby-SAML libraries, which are used to manage SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) authentication.  This issue arises when the SAML response sent by the Identity Provider (IdP) to GitLab is misconfigured or modified. This allows attackers to craft malicious SAML responses to trick GitLab into recognizing the attacker as an authenticated user, bypassing SAML authentication and gaining access to the GitLab instance.  The vulnerability affects GitLab versions 17.3.3, 17.2.7, 17.1.8, 17.0.8, and 16.11.10.

Researchers found that a hacker group linked to the North Korean government used job scams to penetrate the energy and space industries. They spread new malware called MISTPEN, a previously undiscovered backdoor. Cybersecurity firm Mandiant stated that the group, known as UNC2970 or Lazarus Group, uses tactics impersonating recruiters from leading companies to trick managers or senior executives into opening files containing hidden malware, particularly in the energy and space industries in several countries, including the US, UK, and Singapore. This attack starts by sending emails or WhatsApp messages, tricking victims into opening ZIP files that appear to be job-related documents.  But when these PDF files are opened, they require the use of a modified Sumatra PDF program to inject malware into the victim's system. MISTPEN is malware designed to be installed on the system and controlled via a command-and-control server.

According to multiple sources, one source told BleepingComputer that CDK is negotiating with the ransomware group to obtain a decryptor to prevent the leak of stolen data.  The negotiations came after a BlackSuit Ransomware attack forced CDK to shut down its IT systems and data centers to prevent the spread of the attack, including the car dealership platform. The company attempted to restore services on Wednesday but encountered a second cyber incident, forcing another complete shutdown of its IT systems. CDK is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider whose platform is used by car dealerships for all aspects of operations, including sales, finance, inventory, service, and other back-office tasks.  The largest car dealerships, Penske Automotive Group and Sonic Automotive, both revealed they were affected by the outage.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 93/67 (IT) reported on Friday, March 8, 2024, that financial organizations in Vietnam have been targeted by a new cyber attacker group called Lotus Bane. This is part of a cyber attack first detected in March 2023. Group-IB said that this is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group, believed to have been active since 2022. The exact specifics of the attack patterns are still unknown. Group-IB explains that the techniques used by Lotus Bane overlap with OceanLotus, a Vietnamese threat group also known as APT32, Canvas Cyclone (formerly Bismuth), and Cobalt Kitty. This stems from the use of malware such as PIPEDANCE.  It is worth noting that PIPEDANCE was first documented by Elastic Security Labs in February 2023, linked to cyber attacks targeting an unnamed organization in Vietnam in late December 2022. The Lotus Bane group was involved in the attack, primarily targeting the banking sector in the APAC region. Although the attacks took place in Vietnam, their sophisticated methods indicate the potential for attacks on other countries within the APAC group.

It allows the creation of almost any type of website where users can join and become members easily.  The plugin is currently installed on over 200,000 sites.\n\nResearchers at WordPress security firm WPScan noticed new administrator accounts kept appearing on targeted websites. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to create new user accounts with administrator privileges, which can be used to completely take over the website. Researchers explain that the root cause of the issue is the use of a pre-defined list of user meta data keys that users should not be able to manipulate. The plugin uses this list to check if users are trying to register these keys when creating a new account. This security mechanism is considered unsafe.\n\nWPScan didn't provide details about the exploit but shared Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) for these attacks. Researchers at WordFence also observed attacks exploiting this issue. They explain that the flaw is not adequately addressed in the latest available version. \n, Source: Thai-CERT, URL: https://www.thaicert.or.th/2023/07/04/%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%a7%e0%b9%87%e0%b8%9a%e0%b9%84%e0%b8%8b%e0%b8%95%e0%b9%8c-wordpress-%e0%b8%97%e0%b8%b5%e0%b9%88%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%9b%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%b1%e0%b9%8a%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%b4/", "2023", 0]

Rather than searching for a tight-knit relationship between the functions addressed in the setting manipulation category, take a step back and consider the sorts of system values that an attacker should not be allowed to control.\nPhases: Implementation; Architecture and Design\nIn general, do not allow user-provided or otherwise untrusted data to control sensitive values. The leverage that an attacker gains by controlling these values is not always immediately obvious, but do not underestimate the creativity of the attacker.\n, Source: OWASP, URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/15.html", "2006", 1]

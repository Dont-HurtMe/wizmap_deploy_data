The Thai Bankers' Association is warning the public about a new scam targeting people's money. This time, scammers impersonate various agencies and organizations by contacting people through LINE and using various deceptive tactics.  For example, they might pretend to be police officers, forcing victims to turn on their cameras for recording, claiming it's for evidence.  Or they might claim they will transfer money back to the victim and ask for personal information for verification.\n\nNext, the scammers will trick the victim into a video call and then trick them into sharing their screen. They then instruct the victim to dial \"131 followed by their bank app access code# and then press call,\" or some other number sequence that won't actually connect a call. This allows the scammer to see the code entered on the screen and use it to access the victim's banking app and steal their money.\n\nThe Thai Bankers' Association advises everyone to be vigilant and cautious, and not to fall for scammers who create situations to initiate video calls. Never give any personal information, including access codes, to anyone.

This is a domain name scam carried out by international fraudsters and is a significant threat to businesses in Thailand and worldwide.  This article by the TTC-CERT Center delves into the methods of domain name scams, focusing on incidents between November 2023 and January 2024 involving an individual identifying himself as \"Paul Liu,\" a service and operations manager of China Registry. He attempted to use various tricks to deceive the TTC-CERT Center into registering top-level domain names used in China. He sent emails to the TTC-CERT Center attempting to lure them into registering various domain extensions: .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, and .org.cn. By feigning victimhood, the TTC-CERT Center uncovered the modus operandi of this international fraud group and further analyzed the infrastructure that the group might use to deceive organizations both domestically and internationally.

Of these, 4 were identified as legitimate files: PwmTower.exe and nw_elf.dll from TrendMicro, brcc32.exe which is the Borland Resource Compiler, and consent.exe from the Microsoft Windows operating system. There were 3 malware files of the Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) type: nw.dll, rw32core.dll, and Secur32.dll.

The programme is the result of a consultation process involving both the  Permanent Stakeholder Group (PSG) and Management Board (MB). This process has enabled the Agency to increase its focus on areas that are both strongly aligned with the European policy agenda and also considered as core areas of competency for the Agency.\n\nThe content of the Work Programme is a logical extension of work carried out in previous years, but is increasingly focused on a common set of issues. In Work Stream 1 for example, which is concerned with understanding the evolving threat environment and defining suitable mitigation strategies, the areas of application are Critical Infrastructure and Trust Infrastructure. This focus on core issues will allow the Agency to exploit synergies between the different activities that constitute the work programme as a whole and is expected to provide stakeholders with a more holistic view of the state of Network and Information Security  in these areas.\nAs in previous years,  recognises the need to avoid duplication of work and has sought to define activities that are complementary to those undertaken by other European bodies or by other stakeholder communities in general.\nMore information:\n Work Programme 2013", "2012", 0]

The report is targeted primarily at e-communication providers, and at a second level, to National Regulatory Authorities as members of ’s Article 13a Experts Group.\nMost of the providers, report a very good level of using  recommendations on security requirements, while virtually all providers have deployed a good level of basic security controls. In some security domains, the level of maturity reported, is high as well as the sophistication of implemented controls.\nIt is important that providers of electronic communications take the appropriate measures to address major security concerns. A key conclusion seems to be that while all IT security basics are covered, the achievement of the next level of maturity is impeded mostly by lack of sustainability mechanisms, i.e. repeatable processes and the regularly maintained documentation.\nThe main recommendation for the providers - based on the reported deployment of security measures - is to pay additional attention to sustainability and efficiency. This is best achieved by the adoption of Service Management frameworks and creating a series of processes that include measurement and periodic reviews of security controls and capabilities in all domains.\nFull report\nis available\nhere\nFor interviews and press enquir\nies please contact\npress@.europa.eu\nTel\n.+30 2814 409576", "2017", 0]

The trend, also known as consumerization of IT (COIT), can be very attractive to both employers and workers, offering flexibility both ways.\n\n’s new report,\nConsumerization of IT: Risk Mitigation Strategies and Good Practices\nlooks at the latest developments, and delivers six key messages to help ensure that “bring your own device” doesn’t also bring unforeseen risks.\nAimed at Chief Information Officers, Chief Executives and others who take IT security decisions, the report’s messages are:\n1. Ensure that governance aspects are derived from business processes and protection requirements, and are defined before dealing with technology.\n2. End-user involvement can effectively mitigate risks. Awareness-raising on COIT programmes is highly effective for the enforcement of security policies.\n3. Periodic risk assessment on COIT programmes should be undertaken to ensure that security policies remain compatible with evolving technologies.\n4. Keep in mind that encryption complements but does not replace strategic risk management within a COIT programme.\n5. Perform small steps initially and proceed with more complex policies when sufficient experience has been gained.\n6. It is important to identify which COIT risks need to be mitigated within your organisation while the window of opportunity till remains open\nThe report builds on ’s October 2012 publication,\nConsumerization of IT: Top Risks and Opportunities\n, and was produced by  with input and comments from a group of experts from industry, academia and public sector organisations.\nFor the full report:\nConsumerization of IT: Risk Mitigation Strategies and Good Practices", "2013", 0]

Education should bring a stronger awareness about the need for security in products, both from the supplier side and the customer.

The Github readme page for UACME contains an extensive list of methods\n that have been discovered and implemented, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:\nAnother bypass is possible through some lateral movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on remote systems and default to high integrity.\n", "2020", 1]

A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.\nDifferent ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.\n With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed. Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.\nACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists. When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets.

This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.\nAnother variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS.

If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm.

It then installs a plugin named plugin.php, which collects data such as administrator accounts and logs, and sends the data disguised as image requests to evade security detection.  C/side states that the malware also includes steps to verify the success of the attack, such as checking whether the account and plugin have been created and activated, to systematically track the status of the attack. For prevention, c/side recommends blocking the wp3[.]xyz domain using firewalls and security tools, checking administrator accounts and installed plugins for unusual activity, and adding CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection using short-lived server-side tokens.  Furthermore, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) will enhance security. ", "2025", 0]

Romania's Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) believes Russia employed tactics to interfere in Eastern European elections, viewing Romania as an \"enemy\" due to its support for NATO and Ukraine. This interference includes disinformation campaigns, propaganda, and backing anti-EU agendas.  Intelligence agencies warn that Romania's electoral systems remain vulnerable and at risk of future attacks. ", "2024", 0]

The Ugandan government confirmed on Thursday that the country's central bank was hit by a cyberattack by financially motivated threat actors, resulting in a significant loss of funds. The attack is under investigation by the Criminal Investigations Directorate (CID) of the police and the Office of the Auditor General (OAG).  Henry Musasizi, the junior finance minister, revealed in parliament that some central bank accounts were hacked. However, the losses might not be as severe as reported in some media outlets. He added that the bank has undertaken a thorough account reconciliation and investigation into the incident. The Bank of Uganda indicated that the attack involved a threat actor group called “Waste,” believed to be operating from Southeast Asia. The group moved 62 billion Ugandan shillings (approximately $16.8 million) to foreign accounts in early November. According to local media reports, some of the money was transferred to accounts in Japan and the United Kingdom. Authorities in the UK were able to seize more than $7 million, although some had already been withdrawn. In Japan, the attackers reportedly received about $6 million. The central bank has managed to recover some of the funds. The investigation is ongoing to identify those involved and to implement preventive measures for the future. ", "2024", 0]

TikTok has been banned on government devices since February 2023.  TikTok responded that closing the office in Canada will result in hundreds of employees being laid off.  The company intends to challenge this order in court.  In a statement, ByteDance confirmed that no user data will be shared with the Chinese government. However, concerns remain that TikTok may be forced to hand over user data. This has resulted in the U.S. enacting a law requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok by January 2025 or face a ban in the country. Currently, TikTok is completely banned in several countries, including Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, and is prohibited on government-issued devices in many countries around the world.

Attackers can trick victims into opening a specially crafted email, causing JavaScript code to run that can access sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. This information is then sent to a server controlled by the hackers, hosted on Cloudflare. Currently, it is not clear who is behind the attacks, but Positive Technologies points out that hacker groups APT28, Winter Vivern, and TAG-70 have previously used similar vulnerabilities in Roundcube. This incident highlights the importance of keeping software up-to-date, as vulnerabilities discovered and patched as early as May 2024 can still easily lead to valuable data theft if not updated.

These cables encompass stations, software, and land-based components related to the cables, which require a global strategy for protection.  In addition, the U.S. government warned of the increasing reliance on undersea cables amid geopolitical conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, as well as tensions in other regions, such as between China and Taiwan, which could make undersea cables targets of attacks and cause global internet disruptions. The statement also calls on all countries to cooperate to create stronger security management and maintenance systems, including regular risk assessments. It also emphasizes secure infrastructure design, promoting the selection of secure service providers, and supporting cooperation between government and industry. ", "2024", 0]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 333/67 (IT) Friday, September 20, 2024. GitLab has released an update to address a Critical vulnerability affecting the Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). This is a SAML authentication bypass, tracked as CVE-2024-45409, with a CVSS score of 10. The vulnerability stems from an issue in GitLab's OmniAuth-SAML and Ruby-SAML libraries, which are used to manage SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) authentication.  This issue arises when the SAML response sent by the Identity Provider (IdP) to GitLab is misconfigured or modified. This allows attackers to craft malicious SAML responses to trick GitLab into recognizing the attacker as an authenticated user, bypassing SAML authentication and gaining access to the GitLab instance.  The vulnerability affects GitLab versions 17.3.3, 17.2.7, 17.1.8, 17.0.8, and 16.11.10. GitLab has updated OmniAuth SAML to version 2.2.1 and Ruby-SAML to version 1.17.0 and recommends users update to the latest versions as soon as possible.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 332/67 (IT) Friday, September 20, 2024. Researchers found that a hacker group linked to the North Korean government used job scams to penetrate the energy and space industries. They spread new malware called MISTPEN, a previously undiscovered backdoor. Cybersecurity firm Mandiant stated that the group, known as UNC2970 or Lazarus Group, uses tactics impersonating recruiters from leading companies to trick managers or senior executives into opening files containing hidden malware, particularly in the energy and space industries in several countries, including the US, UK, and Singapore. This attack starts by sending emails or WhatsApp messages, tricking victims into opening ZIP files that appear to be job-related documents.  But when these PDF files are opened, they require the use of a modified Sumatra PDF program to inject malware into the victim's system. MISTPEN is malware designed to be installed on the system and controlled via a command-and-control server.  This hacker group also has a history of using modified open-source software to carry out attacks in this manner, and researchers also found that this malware has become more sophisticated over time and conceals traces of the attack seamlessly.

A remote attack occurred via pagers used by the Hezbollah group in Lebanon and Syria, resulting in at least 9 deaths and more than 2,800 injuries. This incident occurred simultaneously across Lebanon and is believed to be an attack targeting pagers used by Hezbollah for covert communication to avoid tracking by Israeli intelligence. One of the deceased is the child of a Hezbollah member of parliament, while the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon was slightly injured. The exploded pagers are the latest model recently adopted by Hezbollah. Experts believe this may be a Supply Chain Attack, where the pagers might have been modified before delivery to detonate when remotely controlled. CNN reported that the pagers may have been tampered with during manufacturing or transportation, leading to this attack. Although there is no official confirmation of the cause, many experts emphasize that devices using lithium-ion batteries do not have such an explosion risk.  It is therefore possible that these pagers were intentionally designed to explode. The situation is still under investigation. ", "2024", 0]

Cybersecurity researchers recommend users immediately upgrade Adobe Acrobat Reader and Adobe Acrobat after the discovery of a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-41869) which could be exploited to execute remote code. This vulnerability was discovered through the EXPMON platform and a publicly released Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit.  By opening a specially crafted PDF file, attackers can leverage this vulnerability to access memory and execute malicious code.  The vulnerability is related to a \"Use-After-Free\" error, where the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unexpected behavior such as crashes or freezes.  If attackers manage to inject malicious code into that memory location, they can easily execute it on the target device. Although a security update was released in August, it reportedly did not fully address the issue. Users who updated to the new version still experienced application crashes when clicking or closing a specific dialog box. However, Adobe has since released the latest update that fixes this flaw. Therefore, to ensure the security of data and devices, users should immediately upgrade their software to the latest version. ", "2024", 0]

The new ransomware group Mad Liberator is a threat group to watch out for after Sophos X-Ops discovered that the group is using the remote access application AnyDesk to attack users. They create fake Microsoft Windows update screens to conceal data theft from users. Mad Liberator has been operating since July 2024, focusing more on data theft than encryption attacks, the typical pattern of common ransomware. The group uses social engineering techniques to trick victims into allowing AnyDesk connections by misleading them into thinking it is maintenance from the company's IT department. Once the attackers establish a connection, they transfer files disguised as Windows updates into the victim's system. This fake update screen helps conceal data theft from OneDrive and files on the central server. This attack takes about four hours. The attack underscores the importance of training employees on managing remote sessions and using Anydesk access controls to prevent future attacks.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 287/67 (IT) Tuesday, August 13, 2024. FreeBSD has released a security update to address a critical vulnerability in OpenSSH, which could be exploited by attackers to remotely execute code with root privileges. The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2024-7589 and has a CVSS score of 7.4, indicating high severity. This vulnerability is related to signal handling in sshd (8) that may invoke unsafe logging functionality when a client fails to authenticate within the configured LoginGraceTime, which is typically 120 seconds. This process runs with root privileges, creating a risk that attackers could execute remote code. FreeBSD recommends users update OpenSSH to a supported version and restart sshd immediately to mitigate this threat. If updating is not feasible, users can reduce the risk by setting LoginGraceTime to 0 in the sshd_config file. While this increases the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, it will prevent remote code execution. ", "No date found", 0]

Cybersecurity researcher Patrick Wardle has revealed the latest campaign by North Korean-backed hackers, known for scamming victims with fake job postings. This time, they're using a new version of the BeaverTail malware to trick macOS users into downloading a malicious version of Microtalk, a video call service.  Wardle explains in his report that the attackers lure victims into downloading a Microtalk update file infected with BeaverTail malware by asking them to participate in a job interview. \"Even though the fake website states 'you can start your next video chat with a single click, without downloading anything,' some users may not read all the details,\" Wardle said.  In addition to stealing data from victims' devices, BeaverTail malware can also load additional malware onto the system, including InvisibleFerret.  The report adds that North Korean hackers are skilled at targeting macOS users with social engineering attacks.  The campaign demonstrates the development of new techniques and methods by North Korean hackers to deceive and attack users, especially in the context of job searches and interviews. ", "2024", 0]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 226/67 (IT) Wednesday, June 26, 2024. Neiman Marcus has disclosed a data breach affecting 64,000 people, as hackers announced the sale of customer data.  The investigation found that hackers gained access to personal information such as names, contact information, birthdays, and gift card numbers, but did not disclose gift card PINs. Neiman Marcus took control of the issue and immediately disabled access to the database, while also launching an investigation with cybersecurity experts and law enforcement. After the breach was revealed, a hacker using the name ‘Sp1d3r’ announced the sale of the Neiman Marcus database on a cybercrime forum, stating that they were demanding a ransom from the company, but the company refused to pay. The data was sold for $150,000 and claimed to contain information on over 180 million users, including information such as names, addresses, birthdays, email addresses, and some social security numbers. The campaign reportedly targeted customers who stored data on the Snowflake cloud, which is accessed by at least 165 organizations such as Ticketmaster, Santander Bank, Anheuser-Busch, Allstate, Advance Auto Parts, Mitsubishi, Progressive, and State Farm. Neiman Marcus confirmed to SecurityWeek that the incident was related to the Snowflake attack and is notifying the 64,000 affected customers, adding that the hacker's claims are exaggerated.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 223/67 (IT) Monday, June 24, 2024. The BlackSuit Ransomware group is behind the CDK Global IT system outage that significantly impacted car dealership operations across North America. According to multiple sources, one source told BleepingComputer that CDK is negotiating with the ransomware group to obtain a decryptor to prevent the leak of stolen data.  The negotiations came after a BlackSuit Ransomware attack forced CDK to shut down its IT systems and data centers to prevent the spread of the attack, including the car dealership platform. The company attempted to restore services on Wednesday but encountered a second cyber incident, forcing another complete shutdown of its IT systems. CDK is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider whose platform is used by car dealerships for all aspects of operations, including sales, finance, inventory, service, and other back-office tasks.  The largest car dealerships, Penske Automotive Group and Sonic Automotive, both revealed they were affected by the outage. BleepingComputer contacted CDK for more information about the incident but has not yet received a response. The BlackSuit group launched in May 2023 and is suspected to be a rebrand of the Royal Ransomware group.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added the CVE-2022-38028 Microsoft Windows Print Spooler Privilege Escalation vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog after Microsoft reported that the APT28 group, linked to Russia and also known as Forest Blizzard, Fancybear, or Strontium, has used a tool called GooseEgg to exploit the Windows Print Spooler vulnerability CVE-2022-38028. Although GooseEgg is a simple launcher application, attackers can use it to launch other applications with elevated privileges.  By exploiting this, attackers can use the tool to carry out various malicious activities such as remote code execution and installing backdoors. To mitigate the risk of this vulnerability, agencies under the Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) must patch the identified vulnerability by the deadline to prevent attacks and exploitation. Experts recommend that private sector organizations also check the vulnerability catalog and patch the vulnerability. CISA has ordered government agencies to patch the vulnerability by May 14, 2024.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 118/67 (IT) Tuesday, March 26, 2024. Resecurity has observed a significant increase in fraud and scam activity during Ramadan in the Middle East. Organizations in the Middle East face increased fraud risks, especially in Saudi Arabia, where consumer spending ranks highest in the region, exceeding $16 billion. This surge is driven by rapidly increasing e-commerce activity, which has attracted cybercriminals seeking to exploit platforms for scams, resulting in significant financial impacts for both consumers and businesses.  The overall financial impact is estimated between $70 and $100 million. Resecurity has protected its clients by blocking over 320 fraud and scam attempts impersonating logistics providers and e-government services. Cybercriminals exploit platforms like Sadad, Musaned, Ajeer, Ejar, and well-known logistics services to trick internet users into various scams. Resecurity advises clients not to disclose personal and payment information on suspicious websites or to individuals impersonating bank or government employees.

Website security company Sucuri warns that more than 39,000 websites are infected with a new family of malware that redirects website visitors to fraudulent domains and unwanted advertisements. The name Sign1 comes from the discovery of JavaScript malware in WordPress custom HTML widgets or within the Simple Custom CSS and JS WordPress plugin that attackers added to compromised websites. Using this method, hackers spread malware to websites without placing malicious code in server files, allowing the malware to go unnoticed for long periods, as it is common for security providers to scan website files for malware rather than checking databases. The injected code is responsible for changing the URL to be executed in the victim's browser every 10 minutes, but only if the visitor comes from major websites such as Facebook, Google, Instagram, and Yahoo. In the past six months, Sucuri has identified more than 39,000 websites infected with various forms of this malware, and recently more than 2,500 websites have been infected in the past two months. Therefore, maintaining security, system administration, and website monitoring should be a top priority for website owners. ", "2024", 0]

He was charged with conspiracy to commit access device fraud and computer fraud, and possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices. He pleaded guilty on December 1, 2023.  The E-Root Marketplace operated through a widely distributed network and was able to hide the identities of administrators, buyers, and sellers. Buyers could search for compromised computer credentials on E-Root, such as usernames and passwords, that would allow buyers to remotely access computers for the purpose of stealing personal information or manipulating computer content remotely. The marketplace also concealed transaction paths by using an online payment system called Perfect Money, which allowed Bitcoin to be converted to Perfect Money.  The infrastructure associated with E-Root and Perfect Money was seized by law enforcement in late 2020.

These emails trick users into downloading a ZIP file and subsequently use DLL side-loading techniques to finally install the malware. The attack chain involves the use of DocuSign-themed lures (electronic signature transaction management system) to trick users into opening a PDF file with a button to read and sign a document. Clicking this button leads to the retrieval of an installer file from a shortened link using the Goo.su URL shortening service.  Inside the installer is an executable file named \"Lightshot.exe,\" which utilizes DLL side-loading to load \"Lightshot.dll,\" which is the CHAVECLOAK malware. This allows attackers to steal sensitive information, log keystrokes, and display deceptive pop-up windows to victims. ", "2024", 0]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 93/67 (IT) reported on Friday, March 8, 2024, that financial organizations in Vietnam have been targeted by a new cyber attacker group called Lotus Bane. This is part of a cyber attack first detected in March 2023. Group-IB said that this is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group, believed to have been active since 2022. The exact specifics of the attack patterns are still unknown. Group-IB explains that the techniques used by Lotus Bane overlap with OceanLotus, a Vietnamese threat group also known as APT32, Canvas Cyclone (formerly Bismuth), and Cobalt Kitty. This stems from the use of malware such as PIPEDANCE.  It is worth noting that PIPEDANCE was first documented by Elastic Security Labs in February 2023, linked to cyber attacks targeting an unnamed organization in Vietnam in late December 2022. The Lotus Bane group was involved in the attack, primarily targeting the banking sector in the APAC region. Although the attacks took place in Vietnam, their sophisticated methods indicate the potential for attacks on other countries within the APAC group.  Ongoing investigations may shed more light on their origins. The presence and activities of the Lotus Bane group in the APAC region highlight the need for continuous vigilance and strong cybersecurity measures. ", "2024", 0]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 58/67 (IT) Monday, February 12, 2024. BleepingComputer reports that the car manufacturer Hyundai Motor Europe was breached by the Ransomware group Black Basta, which claims to have stolen three terabytes of data from the company. The incident occurred in January when the company experienced IT issues resulting in downtime caused by the ransomware attack. However, the company did not disclose the information. Later, Hyundai informed BleepingComputer that it had experienced a cyberattack without providing details about the incident. Hyundai initiated an investigation into the incident and received assistance from external cybersecurity and legal experts. They also notified relevant local authorities.

Whether accidentally or intentionally, the worm-type malware has spread to organizations in other countries. This group, known by various names such as Gamaredon, Primitive Bear, ACTINIUM, Armageddon, and Shuckworm, has been operating since at least 2014 and has been identified as a Russian state security service hacking group.  One of the tools used in the attacks against Ukraine is a worm called LitterDrifter.  This malware, written in Visual Basic Scripting, is designed to spread from one computer to another via USB drives and has two functions: to spread from USB drive to USB drive and to spread itself to devices connected to those drives.  The malware constantly communicates with command-and-control servers operated by the Gamaredon group.  The Gamaredon group focuses its attacks on various Ukrainian targets, but due to the nature of the worm, researchers have observed its spread to countries such as the United States, Vietnam, Chile, Poland, and Germany.  Researchers have also observed evidence of spread in Hong Kong. This may indicate that LitterDrifter is spreading beyond the intended targets of the Russian hackers. ", "2023", 0]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 490/66 (IT) Tuesday, November 14, 2023 reported a cyberattack on DP World Australia, a major Australian transportation company.  This may be a ransomware attack. It has resulted in disruptions at major ports. In response to the attack, DP World disconnected systems from the internet and shut down ground operations at ports in Sydney, Melbourne, Fremantle, and Brisbane.  Darren Goldie, Australia's National Cyber Security Coordinator, said ships could still load and unload containers, but could not leave port. The Australian government is currently assisting the company in restoring normal operations. DP World has not disclosed any information about the attack.  Although the shutdown is in response to a ransomware attack, renowned researcher Kevin Beaumont has reported it as a ransomware attack and that attackers exploited a recently disclosed Citrix Netscaler vulnerability called CitrixBleed, which has been widely exploited in attacks.

The Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 489/66 (IT) reported on Tuesday, November 14, 2023, that at the end of October, the Lockbit ransomware group added Boeing to the list of victims on its data leak site. The group claimed to have stolen a large amount of sensitive data from the company and threatened to publish it if the company did not contact them by a deadline of November 2, 2023, later extended to November 10, 2023.  In early November 2023, Boeing confirmed that its services division had been affected by a cyberattack and said that the investigation was ongoing. The attack targeted elements of the parts and distribution business run by the global services division, and the company reported the incident to law enforcement and relevant regulatory bodies.  However, Boeing refused to pay the ransom demanded, and the LockBit group has now published over 40GB of data. Bleeping Computer analyzed the leaked data and reported that it mostly consists of backups for various systems. The most recent document in the leak is dated October 22, 2023.  It is currently unclear how the attackers breached the company, but some experts speculate that they may have exploited the CVE-2023-4966 vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler ADC/Gateway devices.

Both vulnerabilities are critical, allowing attackers to create unauthorized Confluence administrator accounts and cause data loss.  On November 6, Atlassian updated its advisory, noting multiple instances of the vulnerability being exploited and is adjusting the vulnerability's CVSS score from 9.8 to 10.0, indicating maximum severity.  The escalation is due to a change in the attack scope, with numerous threat actors and exploits targeting vulnerable internet-facing Atlassian Confluence servers to retrieve malicious payloads hosted on remote servers, which leads to the execution of ransomware payloads on compromised servers.  Data collected by GreyNoise indicates that exploitation attempts originate from IP addresses in three different countries: France, Hong Kong, and Russia. ", "2023", 0]

The Philippines' Department of National Defense warned of the risks of using AI-powered applications to create images of individuals and ordered its personnel to immediately cease using such apps.  On October 14, Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. issued an order to stop using AI-powered image generation applications and to exercise caution in sharing information online.  This is due to the Philippine forces' ongoing efforts to quell decades-long communist and Muslim insurgencies, and to protect its interests in the disputed South China Sea.  It is currently unclear whether the order was issued in response to a specific incident or to address potential attacks aimed at exploiting data collected by these AI-powered applications. However, the memo warns about applications used to create digital avatar profile pictures after users submit at least 10 pictures of themselves. The avatars can then mimic how users actually speak and move.  The order states that these AI-powered applications pose significant privacy and security risks, as they can be misused to create fake profiles that can lead to identity theft, social engineering, phishing attacks, and other malicious activities.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 17/66 (OT) Wednesday, October 18, 2023. A vulnerability affecting some industrial routers from Chinese CCTV product manufacturer Milesight may be exploited in attacks. Several UR series industrial cellular routers from Milesight (Ursalink) are affected by CVE-2023-43261, a high-severity vulnerability that exposes system log files, such as ‘httpd.log’. The exposed logs contain passwords for the administrator and other users, which can be exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers to gain unauthorized access to the targeted devices. Passwords are not stored in plain text in the log files, but they can be easily decoded. Researcher Bipin Jitiya disclosed details of the vulnerability and publicly released a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit, and notified Milesight of the findings. Milesight says UR series routers can be deployed in various sectors, including industrial automation, traffic signaling, medical devices, and retail.  Analysis of various firmware versions conducted by VulnCheck suggests that CVE-2023-43261 may have been present for several years.

Experts warn of a critical Zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2023-42115 (CVSS score 9.8), in all versions of the Exim Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) software.  This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit it and execute remote code (RCE) on exposed internet servers.  The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write issue within the SMTP service, caused by a lack of validation of user-supplied data. This allows remote attackers to run arbitrary code on affected Exim installations. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.  Researchers disclosed the vulnerability via ZDI on June 6, 2022, and ZDI reported it to the vendor on June 14, 2022. On September 25, 2023, ZDI requested an update and informed the vendor of their intention to publicly disclose the Zero-day on September 27, 2023.

The Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 379/66 (IT) reported on Friday, August 18, 2023, that cybersecurity firm Cofense has discovered a QR code phishing campaign targeting leading energy companies in the United States to steal users' Microsoft credentials across multiple industries.  Most links included in the phishing messages contain Bing redirect URLs. Other prominent domains include krxd[.]com (linked to Salesforce applications) and cf-ipfs[.]com (Cloudflare's Web3 service).  Using QR codes offers advantages over embedding phishing links directly in emails, most importantly the ability to bypass anti-phishing solutions, as the phishing link is hidden within the QR code image. Researchers observed a monthly growth percentage for this campaign exceeding 270%. The overall campaign has grown by more than 2,400% since May 2023. Researchers say this is the largest campaign ever using QR codes observed by Cofense, a situation suggesting that attackers are testing the effectiveness of QR codes. The phishing messages used in this campaign contain a PNG image file or a PDF file with a QR code. The message content attempts to trick recipients into scanning the code to verify their account.  The email message urges recipients to complete the process within 2-3 days. Experts warn that the energy sector is the main focus of this campaign, followed by the manufacturing and insurance sectors.  ", "2023", 0]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 345/66 (IT) Friday, July 14, 2023.  A new fileless malware called PyLoose is targeting cloud workloads to hijack computing resources to mine Monero cryptocurrency. PyLoose is a relatively simple Python script with a compiled, base64-encoded XMRig miner, an open-source tool that leverages CPU power to solve complex algorithms necessary for the cryptocurrency.  Researchers from Wiz stated that PyLoose’s direct execution from memory makes detection by security tools difficult. Fileless malware doesn’t leave traces on the system’s drive, making it hard to detect. It typically leverages legitimate system tools to inject malicious code into legitimate processes. Wiz security researchers first detected the PyLoose attacks on June 22, 2023, and have since confirmed over 200 instances. Researchers haven't been able to attribute the PyLoose attacks to a specific threat actor, as the attackers didn't leave any clues behind.  They recommend that cloud instance administrators avoid publicly exposing services vulnerable to code execution, utilize strong passwords and multi-factor authentication to protect access to these services, and implement system command execution restrictions.

Hackers are exploiting a critical, unpatched vulnerability in the WordPress plugin, tracked as CVE-2023-3460 (CVSS score: 9.8), to create rogue administrator accounts.  Ultimate Member is a popular WordPress membership plugin that allows administrators to create advanced online communities and membership sites. It allows the creation of almost any type of website where users can join and become members easily.  The plugin is currently installed on over 200,000 sites.\n\nResearchers at WordPress security firm WPScan noticed new administrator accounts kept appearing on targeted websites. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to create new user accounts with administrator privileges, which can be used to completely take over the website. Researchers explain that the root cause of the issue is the use of a pre-defined list of user meta data keys that users should not be able to manipulate. The plugin uses this list to check if users are trying to register these keys when creating a new account. This security mechanism is considered unsafe.\n\nWPScan didn't provide details about the exploit but shared Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) for these attacks. Researchers at WordFence also observed attacks exploiting this issue. They explain that the flaw is not adequately addressed in the latest available version. \n", "2023", 0]

TSMC is the world's largest chip manufacturer for the technology sector, including Apple and Qualcomm Inc.  On Wednesday, BleepingComputer reported that a Lockbit affiliate called Bassterlord announced the attack on TSMC via Twitter and published images containing company-related data as proof of the attack. The group claimed to have stolen a large amount of sensitive data from the company and threatened to publish it if payment was refused.  The group initially gave TSMC seven days to pay the ransom but later extended the deadline to August 6. TSMC denied being breached by Lockbit but confirmed that the group had breached Kinmax Technology, one of its IT hardware suppliers. The investigation into the incident revealed no impact on TSMC's core operations and no compromise of TSMC customer data. TSMC stated it would not work with the compromised supplier until the situation was resolved. Taiwan's Kinmax Technology also provides services to other prominent companies such as Cisco, Citrix, HPE, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The security breach was discovered on June 29. \n", "2023", 0]

Avast, a cybersecurity company, has released a free decryptor for the Akira ransomware, allowing victims to recover their data without paying ransoms to hackers.  The Akira ransomware is Windows ransomware with a 64-bit Windows binary, written in C++ and using the Boost library for asynchronous cryptographic operations. The authors used Microsoft Linker version 14.35. Attacks began in March 2023, with hackers behind the malware claiming to have breached several organizations across multiple industries, including education, finance, and real estate.\n\nDecryption method: The first step is to download the Avast decryptor binary, which is a 64-bit decryptor as the ransomware itself is 64-bit and won't run on 32-bit Windows. If you have no choice but to use 32-bit applications, you can download a 32-bit decryptor. Avast released both a 64-bit and a 32-bit Windows decryptor. Victims need to prepare two files: one encrypted by Akira ransomware and the original file. Avast is working on creating a decryptor for the Linux version and has released IOCs for both the Windows and Linux versions.\n\n", "2023", 0]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT).  Unprecedented cyberattacks are impacting government infrastructure systems in Montenegro, and the government has taken measures to mitigate the impact. The attacks began Thursday night. The U.S. Embassy in Montenegro advises U.S. citizens to limit movements and travel within the country to what is essential and to have current and readily accessible travel documents, fearing that the attacks could impact government infrastructure for identifying those residing in Montenegro and transportation.  The National Security Agency issued a warning to organizations operating critical infrastructure.  Milutin Đukanović, president of the EPCG board, revealed that the state-owned electric utility switched to manual operations to prevent potential damage. The company also opted to temporarily disable some customer services as a precaution. The government believes the attacks are the work of state-sponsored hackers.  In June 2017, Montenegro was targeted by the APT28 hacker group linked to Russia, after Montenegro officially joined the NATO alliance, despite strong opposition from the Russian government, which threatened retaliation.\n", "2022", 0]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) reports that the personal information of over 2.5 million students from the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) and EdFinancial was exposed after hackers breached the systems of technology provider Nelnet Servicing. Both OSLA and EdFinancial utilized Nelnet Servicing, including its web portal, to provide online access for students to manage their loan accounts. The incident, which began in June 2022, involved unknown attackers who compromised Nelnet Servicing and remained in the system until July 22nd.  The hackers likely exploited a vulnerability to gain access to the company's network. Although Nelnet blocked the cyberattack as soon as it was detected, the investigation, completed on August 17, 2022, revealed the following exposed data: name, address, email, phone number, and social security number.

Microsoft stated that the threat group, known as MuddyWater (also known as Cobalt Ulster, Mercury, Seedworm, or Static Kitten), is linked to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). The attack used a vulnerable SysAid Server instance, leveraging the Log4Shell vulnerability as the initial access vector. This deviates from their pattern of exploiting VMware applications in targeted attacks.  Once inside, Mercury establishes persistence, drops credentials, and spies on victims using both custom-built and publicly known hacking tools.  The technology threat intelligence team observed the attacks between July 23rd and 25th, 2022. Successful attacks deploy web shells to execute commands, allowing attackers to perform reconnaissance and steal credentials.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) considers the critical vulnerability in the open-source Java-based logging framework a persistent threat.

The intention of this functionality is to bypass authentication and access control checks within the .NET application code.

It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing.\nBy submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as \"file:///c:/winnt/win.ini\" designates (in Windows) the file C:\\Winnt\\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.\nOnce the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML.

The lack of checksum functionality in a protocol removes the first application-level check of data that can be used. The end-to-end philosophy of checks states that integrity checks should be performed at the lowest level that they can be completely implemented. Excluding further sanity checks and input validation performed by applications, the protocol's checksum is the most important level of checksum, since it can be performed more completely than at any previous level and takes into account entire messages, as opposed to single packets.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nAdd an appropriately sized checksum to the protocol, ensuring that data received may be simply validated before it is parsed and used.\nPhase: Implementation\nEnsure that the checksums present in the protocol design are properly implemented and added to each message before it is sent.\n", "2006", 1]

This limits the potential for unintended or unauthorized types and gadgets to be leveraged by the attacker. Add only acceptable classes to an allowlist. Note: new gadgets are constantly being discovered, so this alone is not a sufficient mitigation.\nPhases: Architecture and Design; Implementation\nEmploy cryptography of the data or code for protection. However, it's important to note that it would still be client-side security. This is risky because if the client is compromised then the security implemented on the client (the cryptography) can be bypassed.\n", "2006", 1]

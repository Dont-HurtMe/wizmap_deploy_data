This report perfectly illustrates this fact and provides valuable insight into why different actors behave as they do in the vulnerability disclosure space.”\nVulnerability disclosure refers to the process of identifying, reporting and patching weaknesses of software, hardware or service that can be exploited. The different actors within a vulnerability disclosure process are subject to a range of economic considerations and incentives that may influence their behaviour.\nThese economic aspects of vulnerability disclosure are often overlooked and poorly understood, but may help explain why some vulnerabilities are disclosed responsibly while others are not.

The programme is the result of a consultation process involving both the  Permanent Stakeholder Group (PSG) and Management Board (MB). This process has enabled the Agency to increase its focus on areas that are both strongly aligned with the European policy agenda and also considered as core areas of competency for the Agency.\n\nThe content of the Work Programme is a logical extension of work carried out in previous years, but is increasingly focused on a common set of issues. In Work Stream 1 for example, which is concerned with understanding the evolving threat environment and defining suitable mitigation strategies, the areas of application are Critical Infrastructure and Trust Infrastructure. This focus on core issues will allow the Agency to exploit synergies between the different activities that constitute the work programme as a whole and is expected to provide stakeholders with a more holistic view of the state of Network and Information Security  in these areas.\nAs in previous years,  recognises the need to avoid duplication of work and has sought to define activities that are complementary to those undertaken by other European bodies or by other stakeholder communities in general.\nMore information:\n Work Programme 2013 URL: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-publishes-work-programme-2013", "2012", 0]

The recent\n‘Flamer’\nspyware virus that targeted PCs in a number of Middle Eastern countries shows the international nature of the threat, and highlights the fact that attackers are developing highly specialised malware. Our success in countering these constantly evolving risks depends on our ability to share knowledge across borders - with governments, the IT industry, the academic world and with IT users.

It is also expected to constitute an important technological pillar of a thriving data-driven economy and the European single digital market.\nHowever, virtualization technologies bear a number of different security risks, some of them shared with traditional computing environments including issues affecting operating systems, communication protocols, and applications, which can be even exacerbated by the presence of virtualized components, producing a greater security impact.  On the other side, virtualization also introduces a number of specific security issues requiring ad hoc solutions.\nFull report\nis available\nonline\nFor interviews and press enquiries\nplease contact\npress@.europa.eu\nTel\n. +30 2814409576 URL: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-study-on-the-security-aspects-of-virtualization", "2017", 0]

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.\nWhen initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system.

Ptrace system call injection can also be done with \n/\n, which copy data to a specific address in the target processes’ memory (ex: the current address of the next instruction). \n \nPtrace system call injection may not be possible targeting processes that are non-child processes and/or have higher-privileges.\n \nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.

If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.\nAn adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device.

A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.\nDifferent ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.\n With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed. Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.\nACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists.

Stateless protocols such as UDP or ICMP are commonly used but stateful protocols such as TCP can be used as well.\nBotnets are commonly used to conduct network flooding attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global Internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for distributed DoS (DDoS), so many systems are used to generate the flood that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to saturate the target network. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS flooding attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.\n URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/001/", "2020", 1]

Researchers from the security firm c/side found that the malware uses the domain wp3[.]xyz to send data to the attacker's server. After successfully compromising a system, the malicious script creates an account named \"wpx_admin\" with a password specified in the code. It then installs a plugin named plugin.php, which collects data such as administrator accounts and logs, and sends the data disguised as image requests to evade security detection.  C/side states that the malware also includes steps to verify the success of the attack, such as checking whether the account and plugin have been created and activated, to systematically track the status of the attack. For prevention, c/side recommends blocking the wp3[.]xyz domain using firewalls and security tools, checking administrator accounts and installed plugins for unusual activity, and adding CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection using short-lived server-side tokens.  Furthermore, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) will enhance security.

Spanish telecommunications company Telefónica has confirmed that its internal ticketing system was hacked after stolen data was published on a hacking forum. The company revealed that it has blocked access and thoroughly investigated the incident. Telefónica is Spain's largest multinational telecommunications company, with over 104,000 employees and operates in 12 countries. The incident stemmed from attackers using stolen employee account information to access the system. The attackers claim to have extracted approximately 2.3 GB of internal documents and tickets, some of which may be related to customers, but most are tickets opened with @telefonica.com emails for internal problem reporting.  The attackers claiming responsibility for the incident are identified as DNA, Grep, Pryx, and Rey. Pryx told BleepingComputer that they did not demand a ransom or negotiate with Telefónica before publishing the data. The attack occurred yesterday, and the company immediately reset the passwords of the compromised accounts.  Additionally, members of the groups Grep, Pryx, and Rey are also associated with the \"Hellcat Ransomware\" group, which previously attacked Schneider Electric and stole over 40 GB of data from the company's Jira servers.

Tenable announced a remediation plan, stating: – Nessus Agent systems for Tenable Vulnerability Management (TVM), Tenable Security Center (TSC), and Nessus were downgraded from 10.8.0/10.8.1 back to 10.7. – Plugin feed updates were disabled specifically for Nessus Agent versions below 10.8 and all versions of Nessus Scanner linked to TVM. Tenable has released Nessus Agent version 10.8.2 to address this issue and recommends that users running versions 10.8.0 and 10.8.1 upgrade to version 10.8.2 or downgrade to version 10.7.3.  It is also recommended to reset the plugins if using profiles for agent upgrades or downgrades to bring the agents back online.

A high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2024-43405) with a CVSS score of 7.4 has been identified in Nuclei, an open-source vulnerability scanner.  This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass signature verification and inject malicious code into templates.  The Wiz team reported that the vulnerability stems from differing newline character handling between signature verification and YAML parser data conversion, enabling attackers to insert malicious content while maintaining valid signatures in the normal section.\n\nNuclei supports various protocols, including HTTP, TCP, DNS, and Code, which can execute code on the operating system.  Using unsafe templates could lead to system compromise.  Wiz's report demonstrates that the \"Code\" protocol can be used to extract sensitive information from target systems if weaponized with malicious code.\n\nThis vulnerability affects Nuclei versions 3.0.0 and later and has been patched in version v3.3.2.  Users should verify templates before use to prevent malicious code injection.  Caution should be exercised when allowing users to modify or upload templates in shared systems to avoid the risk of attacks that could lead to unauthorized command execution, data theft, or system control.\n\n URL: https://www.thaicert.or.th/2025/01/07/%e0%b8%9e%e0%b8%9a%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%87%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a7%e0%b9%88-nuclei-%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%aa%e0%b8%b5%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%87%e0%b8%96%e0%b8%b9%e0%b8%81%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%88/", "2025", 0]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 402/67 (IT) Wednesday, November 13, 2024. Kaspersky researchers discovered a new type of ransomware called Ymir being used in attacks alongside the RustyStealer malware, a data-stealing program that infiltrates victim systems before deploying the ransomware.  Ymir attacks networks containing sensitive information, with RustyStealer utilizing techniques to collect credentials and gain system access through privileged accounts. Once installed, Ymir encrypts system files and creates a ransom note in a PDF file to coerce payment.  It also modifies Windows settings to display warning messages on the login screen to further pressure victims into complying with the hackers' demands.  Ymir ransomware operates stealthily by running in memory and uses ChaCha20 encryption, an advanced encryption algorithm, to encrypt data, making decryption difficult.  The malware also scans the system for signs of PowerShell and deletes itself to avoid detection in its final stages. Currently, no data leak site associated with Ymir has been found, suggesting that the attackers may be in the early stages of victim data collection.

The attacks are part of a cyber espionage campaign aimed at gathering information about US leaders. US intelligence agencies are investigating what communications the hackers may have intercepted.  Unnamed sources indicated the hacking group's infiltration was sophisticated, successfully breaching telecommunications systems. The information obtained from Trump and Vance's phones is considered a valuable source of intelligence for foreign entities, particularly in the lead-up to the presidential election. Sources close to the matter informed CNN that the APT group \"Salt Typhoon\" also targeted individuals within the Harris-Walz campaign team and senior Biden administration officials.  The group also demonstrated advanced skills in penetrating communications systems and internet networks of major companies like AT&T, Verizon, and Lume. Once US security agencies identified the attacks, agencies like the FBI and CISA immediately alerted and provided technical assistance to the affected telecommunications companies, and shared information with other companies to prevent future attacks.

This allows attackers to craft malicious SAML responses to trick GitLab into recognizing the attacker as an authenticated user, bypassing SAML authentication and gaining access to the GitLab instance.  The vulnerability affects GitLab versions 17.3.3, 17.2.7, 17.1.8, 17.0.8, and 16.11.10. GitLab has updated OmniAuth SAML to version 2.2.1 and Ruby-SAML to version 1.17.0 and recommends users update to the latest versions as soon as possible. For those who cannot update immediately, GitLab recommends enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for all accounts and setting SAML 2FA bypass to \"Disallow\".

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 332/67 (IT) Friday, September 20, 2024. Researchers found that a hacker group linked to the North Korean government used job scams to penetrate the energy and space industries. They spread new malware called MISTPEN, a previously undiscovered backdoor. Cybersecurity firm Mandiant stated that the group, known as UNC2970 or Lazarus Group, uses tactics impersonating recruiters from leading companies to trick managers or senior executives into opening files containing hidden malware, particularly in the energy and space industries in several countries, including the US, UK, and Singapore. This attack starts by sending emails or WhatsApp messages, tricking victims into opening ZIP files that appear to be job-related documents.  But when these PDF files are opened, they require the use of a modified Sumatra PDF program to inject malware into the victim's system. MISTPEN is malware designed to be installed on the system and controlled via a command-and-control server.  This hacker group also has a history of using modified open-source software to carry out attacks in this manner, and researchers also found that this malware has become more sophisticated over time and conceals traces of the attack seamlessly.

A remote attack occurred via pagers used by the Hezbollah group in Lebanon and Syria, resulting in at least 9 deaths and more than 2,800 injuries. This incident occurred simultaneously across Lebanon and is believed to be an attack targeting pagers used by Hezbollah for covert communication to avoid tracking by Israeli intelligence. One of the deceased is the child of a Hezbollah member of parliament, while the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon was slightly injured. The exploded pagers are the latest model recently adopted by Hezbollah. Experts believe this may be a Supply Chain Attack, where the pagers might have been modified before delivery to detonate when remotely controlled. CNN reported that the pagers may have been tampered with during manufacturing or transportation, leading to this attack. Although there is no official confirmation of the cause, many experts emphasize that devices using lithium-ion batteries do not have such an explosion risk.  It is therefore possible that these pagers were intentionally designed to explode. The situation is still under investigation.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 326/67 (IT) Tuesday, September 17, 2024. Researchers from Aqua Security discovered new malware called \"Hadooken,\" which attacks WebLogic servers.  The malware's name comes from an attack move in the game Street Fighter.  Hadooken's capabilities include installing cryptocurrency mining software (cryptominer) and deploying Tsunami malware, which can be used for later system breaches.  This attack targets WebLogic servers, developed by Oracle and often used in large organizations. Attackers gain access to the servers through weak passwords. They then use shell scripts and Python to download and install the malware on the server, while also attempting to hide traces of the attack. Researchers found that the Hadooken malware was downloaded from two IP addresses: 89.185.85.102 (still active), registered in Germany, and 185.174.136.204 (no longer active), registered in Russia.  The still-active IP has been linked to the TeamTNT and Gang 8220 groups. However, researchers do not yet have enough evidence to confirm the source of this attack.  Searching for additional information through Shodan revealed more than 230,000 WebLogic servers connected to the internet. Although most are well-protected, some may be vulnerable to attack.

Law enforcement agencies from multiple countries have cooperated in the arrest and extradition of Belarusian and Ukrainian nationals believed to be involved with a Russian-speaking cybercrime group.  The operation was coordinated by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA). One of those arrested is Maksim Silnikau, 38, who used the online alias “JP Morgan.” He was extradited from Poland to the United States in August 2024 to face charges related to international computer hacking and wire fraud.  The group was involved in the development and distribution of ransomware such as Reveton and the Angler Exploit Kit, which affected hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide.  Reveton, in particular, launched in 2011, is known as one of the first ransomware-as-a-service operations and reportedly earned the group as much as $400,000 per month.  Silnikau is also charged in connection with operating the Ransom Cartel ransomware, starting in May 2021, and using hidden websites to track and control ransomware attacks. If convicted on all counts, Silnikau could face more than 50 years in prison. This arrest is the result of international cooperation and represents a significant step in the fight against complex transnational cybercrime.

This change comes just months after Google announced its plan to phase out third-party cookies again, which has been postponed several times due to concerns about fair competition in the digital advertising market. This cancellation reflects the challenge of getting industry consensus on a single solution for managing privacy on the internet.

Bryan Vorndran, the FBI's assistant director of the cyber division, speaking at the 2024 Boston Cyber Security Summit on Wednesday, revealed that they have obtained over 7,000 decryption keys for the LockBit ransomware. These keys can be used to recover encrypted data for free.  They are calling on victims of LockBit ransomware attacks to come forward to help them restore their data and resume normal operations.  “We are reaching out to LockBit victims to help, encouraging those who suspect they are LockBit victims to visit our Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov.”  This assistance to LockBit victims follows law enforcement's seizure of LockBit infrastructure in February 2024 in an international collaborative operation called “Operation Cronos”.  At that time, police seized 34 servers containing over 2,500 decryption keys, which helped create free LockBit decryptors. After analyzing the seized data, the UK's National Crime Agency and the US Department of Justice estimate that the criminal gang and its affiliates extorted up to $1 billion after 7,000 attacks targeting organizations worldwide between June 2022 and February 2024.

Website security company Sucuri warns that more than 39,000 websites are infected with a new family of malware that redirects website visitors to fraudulent domains and unwanted advertisements. The name Sign1 comes from the discovery of JavaScript malware in WordPress custom HTML widgets or within the Simple Custom CSS and JS WordPress plugin that attackers added to compromised websites. Using this method, hackers spread malware to websites without placing malicious code in server files, allowing the malware to go unnoticed for long periods, as it is common for security providers to scan website files for malware rather than checking databases. The injected code is responsible for changing the URL to be executed in the victim's browser every 10 minutes, but only if the visitor comes from major websites such as Facebook, Google, Instagram, and Yahoo. In the past six months, Sucuri has identified more than 39,000 websites infected with various forms of this malware, and recently more than 2,500 websites have been infected in the past two months. Therefore, maintaining security, system administration, and website monitoring should be a top priority for website owners.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 93/67 (IT) reported on Friday, March 8, 2024, that financial organizations in Vietnam have been targeted by a new cyber attacker group called Lotus Bane. This is part of a cyber attack first detected in March 2023. Group-IB said that this is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group, believed to have been active since 2022. The exact specifics of the attack patterns are still unknown. Group-IB explains that the techniques used by Lotus Bane overlap with OceanLotus, a Vietnamese threat group also known as APT32, Canvas Cyclone (formerly Bismuth), and Cobalt Kitty. This stems from the use of malware such as PIPEDANCE.  It is worth noting that PIPEDANCE was first documented by Elastic Security Labs in February 2023, linked to cyber attacks targeting an unnamed organization in Vietnam in late December 2022. The Lotus Bane group was involved in the attack, primarily targeting the banking sector in the APAC region. Although the attacks took place in Vietnam, their sophisticated methods indicate the potential for attacks on other countries within the APAC group.  Ongoing investigations may shed more light on their origins. The presence and activities of the Lotus Bane group in the APAC region highlight the need for continuous vigilance and strong cybersecurity measures.

ThyssenKrupp is one of the world's largest steel producers, with more than 100,000 employees and annual revenue of more than $44.4 billion (2022). A company spokesperson confirmed that the attack only affected the Thyssenkrupp Automotive Body Solutions business unit. The Automotive Body Solutions IT security team worked with the ThyssenKrupp Group IT security team to contain the threat. Therefore, various security measures were implemented, and some system applications were temporarily shut down. ThyssenKrupp further clarified that none of the other units were affected by the cyberattack. BleepingComputer contacted ThyssenKrupp to inquire about the reported outage.

Joomla, an open-source content management system (CMS), has multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution (RCE) attacks. The Sonar vulnerability research team discovered one of the underlying vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2024-21726, which is significant because it affects Joomla's core filtering component. Attackers can exploit this XSS vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into a victim's website. Attackers can steal visitor data, perform malicious redirects, or infect users with malware. In this case, attackers could cause problems by tricking an administrator into clicking a malicious link. Joomla powers approximately 2% of all websites, with most deployments publicly accessible, making these sites potential targets for cyber threat actors. The issue has been addressed in Joomla versions 5.0.3/4.4.3, which have been released. Therefore, users and administrators should update as soon as possible to avoid becoming victims of attackers.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 513/66 (IT) Thursday, November 30, 2023. A recently disclosed security vulnerability affecting Apache ActiveMQ is being exploited by attackers to spread a new Go-based botnet called GoTitan, as well as a .NET program known as PrCtrl Rat, which can remotely control malware-infected hosts.  The attack involves exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2023-46604, CVSS score: 10.0) that has been used in attacks by various hacker groups, including the Lazarus group, in recent weeks. After a successful breach, the threat actors are found to drop further payloads from remote servers. One of these is GoTitan, a botnet designed to orchestrate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks via protocols such as HTTP, UDP, TCP, and TLS. Fortinet has also observed cases where vulnerable Apache ActiveMQ servers are being targeted to deploy another DDoS botnet called Ddostf, Kinsing malware for cryptojacking, and a command-and-control (C2) framework named Sliver. Another prominent malware delivered is a remote access trojan called PrCtrl Rat that establishes contact with a C2 server to receive further instructions for actions on the system, such as collecting data files and downloading and uploading files from the server.

This group, known by various names such as Gamaredon, Primitive Bear, ACTINIUM, Armageddon, and Shuckworm, has been operating since at least 2014 and has been identified as a Russian state security service hacking group.  One of the tools used in the attacks against Ukraine is a worm called LitterDrifter.  This malware, written in Visual Basic Scripting, is designed to spread from one computer to another via USB drives and has two functions: to spread from USB drive to USB drive and to spread itself to devices connected to those drives.  The malware constantly communicates with command-and-control servers operated by the Gamaredon group.  The Gamaredon group focuses its attacks on various Ukrainian targets, but due to the nature of the worm, researchers have observed its spread to countries such as the United States, Vietnam, Chile, Poland, and Germany.  Researchers have also observed evidence of spread in Hong Kong. This may indicate that LitterDrifter is spreading beyond the intended targets of the Russian hackers.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 17/66 (OT) Wednesday, October 18, 2023. A vulnerability affecting some industrial routers from Chinese CCTV product manufacturer Milesight may be exploited in attacks. Several UR series industrial cellular routers from Milesight (Ursalink) are affected by CVE-2023-43261, a high-severity vulnerability that exposes system log files, such as ‘httpd.log’. The exposed logs contain passwords for the administrator and other users, which can be exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers to gain unauthorized access to the targeted devices. Passwords are not stored in plain text in the log files, but they can be easily decoded. Researcher Bipin Jitiya disclosed details of the vulnerability and publicly released a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit, and notified Milesight of the findings. Milesight says UR series routers can be deployed in various sectors, including industrial automation, traffic signaling, medical devices, and retail.  Analysis of various firmware versions conducted by VulnCheck suggests that CVE-2023-43261 may have been present for several years. Shodan and Censys search engines show roughly 5,500 Milesight devices exposed on the internet, but only 6.5%, or less than 400 devices, appear to still be running a vulnerable firmware version.

These vulnerabilities were discovered by Synack Red Team researchers. ScrutisWeb allows organizations to monitor bank or retail ATMs from a web browser, enabling quick responses to issues. Synack researchers identified four vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-33871, CVE-2023-38257, CVE-2023-35763, and CVE-2023-35189.  The vulnerabilities include authorization bypass, hardcoded cryptographic key, and arbitrary file upload, which could be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers. Attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities to obtain information from the server (configuration, logs, and databases) and execute arbitrary commands.  Researchers said attackers could leverage these vulnerabilities to log into the ScrutisWeb management console as an administrator, monitor the activity of connected ATMs, enable management mode on the devices, upload files, and reboot or shut down the machines.  The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has published an advisory to inform organizations about the vulnerabilities. According to CISA, affected products are used worldwide.

A new fileless malware called PyLoose is targeting cloud workloads to hijack computing resources to mine Monero cryptocurrency. PyLoose is a relatively simple Python script with a compiled, base64-encoded XMRig miner, an open-source tool that leverages CPU power to solve complex algorithms necessary for the cryptocurrency.  Researchers from Wiz stated that PyLoose’s direct execution from memory makes detection by security tools difficult. Fileless malware doesn’t leave traces on the system’s drive, making it hard to detect. It typically leverages legitimate system tools to inject malicious code into legitimate processes. Wiz security researchers first detected the PyLoose attacks on June 22, 2023, and have since confirmed over 200 instances. Researchers haven't been able to attribute the PyLoose attacks to a specific threat actor, as the attackers didn't leave any clues behind.  They recommend that cloud instance administrators avoid publicly exposing services vulnerable to code execution, utilize strong passwords and multi-factor authentication to protect access to these services, and implement system command execution restrictions.

This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.\nOrdered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.\nSticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.\nIn addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent.

In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.\nEven if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.\nThis weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning, if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nFully check the hostname of the certificate and provide the user with adequate information about the nature of the problem and how to proceed.\nPhase: Implementation\nIf certificate pinning is being used, ensure that all relevant properties of the certificate are fully validated before the certificate is pinned, including the hostname.\n URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/297.html", "2006", 1]

Inadequate or inconsistent verification may result in insufficient or incorrect identification of either communicating entity. This can have negative consequences such as misplaced trust in the entity at the other end of the channel. An attacker can leverage this by interposing between the communicating entities and masquerading as the original entity.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 361/66 (IT) on Thursday, July 27, 2023, reported a severe privilege escalation issue affecting MikroTik RouterOS.  Attackers can remotely exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code and take complete control of vulnerable devices.  A report released Tuesday revealed the vulnerability, CVE-2023-30799 (CVSS score: 9.1), affects approximately 500,000 RouterOS systems, making them susceptible to attacks via the web or Winbox interface.  VulnCheck notes that CVE-2023-30799 was initially disclosed by Margin Research as an exploit called FOISted (without a CVE identifier).  This vulnerability in Mikrotik routers was exploited to incorporate devices into denial-of-service (DDoS) botnets. Users are strongly advised to patch the vulnerability by updating to the latest version (6.49.8 or 7.x) as soon as possible.  Mitigation recommendations include removing the MikroTik administrative interface from the internet, blocking administrator login IP addresses, disabling Winbox and the web interface, and configuring SSH to use public/private keys and disable passwords.

Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. \nProc memory injection involves enumerating the memory of a process via the /proc filesystem (\n) then crafting a return-oriented programming (ROP) payload with available gadgets/instructions. Each running process has its own directory, which includes memory mappings. Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’ stack using memory mappings provided by the /proc filesystem. This information can be used to enumerate offsets (including the stack) and gadgets (or instructions within the program that can be used to build a malicious payload) otherwise hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout randomization (ASLR). Once enumerated, the target processes’ memory map within \n can be overwritten using dd.\n \nOther techniques such as \n may be used to populate a target process with more available gadgets. Similar to \n, proc memory injection may target child processes (such as a backgrounded copy of sleep).\n \nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.

The attack utilizes sophisticated malware to achieve cyber espionage objectives. The TTC-CERT has named this campaign BangkokShell.\n\nOverall, the BangkokShell campaign leverages open-source projects to develop attack tools and employs various anti-detection measures such as Dynamic API Resolution, Indirect Calls, stackstrings, and multiple encryption types. The BangkokShell attack process begins with DLL Side-loading to load obfuscated shellcode into the process memory before deobfuscating it. It then uses Reflective Code Loading to load and execute the payload, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), without leaving any traces on the filesystem.  TTC-CERT refers to this payload as RahadRAT.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 81/67 (IT) on Thursday, February 29, 2024, disclosed a security vulnerability in the LiteSpeed Cache plugin in WordPress that could allow unauthorized users to escalate their privileges. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-40000, was patched in October 2023 in version 5.7.0.1. The LiteSpeed Cache plugin has been installed over 5 million times, with the latest version, 6.1, released on February 5, 2024. However, WordPress security authorities say CVE-2023-40000 resulted from a lack of user input sanitization and output escaping.  The vulnerability is rooted in a function called update_cdn_status() and is reproducible in default installations.  \"Because the XSS payload is placed as an admin notice, and admin notices can be displayed on wp-admin endpoints, this vulnerability can easily be exploited by users with access to the wp-admin area.\" This allows authenticated attackers with contributor-level privileges and above to inject arbitrary web scripts into web pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 333/67 (IT) Friday, September 20, 2024. GitLab has released an update to address a Critical vulnerability affecting the Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). This is a SAML authentication bypass, tracked as CVE-2024-45409, with a CVSS score of 10. The vulnerability stems from an issue in GitLab's OmniAuth-SAML and Ruby-SAML libraries, which are used to manage SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) authentication.  This issue arises when the SAML response sent by the Identity Provider (IdP) to GitLab is misconfigured or modified. This allows attackers to craft malicious SAML responses to trick GitLab into recognizing the attacker as an authenticated user, bypassing SAML authentication and gaining access to the GitLab instance.  The vulnerability affects GitLab versions 17.3.3, 17.2.7, 17.1.8, 17.0.8, and 16.11.10. GitLab has updated OmniAuth SAML to version 2.2.1 and Ruby-SAML to version 1.17.0 and recommends users update to the latest versions as soon as possible. For those who cannot update immediately, GitLab recommends enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for all accounts and setting SAML 2FA bypass to \"Disallow\".

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 109/67 (IT) Wednesday, March 20, 2024.  31-year-old Sandu Boris Diaconu was sentenced to 42 months in prison in the U.S. for operating an illegal marketplace called E-Root Marketplace, which offered 350,000 stolen credentials for sale. He was charged with conspiracy to commit access device fraud and computer fraud, and possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices. He pleaded guilty on December 1, 2023.  The E-Root Marketplace operated through a widely distributed network and was able to hide the identities of administrators, buyers, and sellers. Buyers could search for compromised computer credentials on E-Root, such as usernames and passwords, that would allow buyers to remotely access computers for the purpose of stealing personal information or manipulating computer content remotely. The marketplace also concealed transaction paths by using an online payment system called Perfect Money, which allowed Bitcoin to be converted to Perfect Money.

Adversaries may exploit remote services by taking advantage of a mobile device’s access to an internal enterprise network through local connectivity or through a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.

These look for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities, or security software that may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation.

Preliminary information indicates that the file was found in the %Public% directory on a server hosting Active Directory (AD) and was attacked by ransomware.\n\nStatic and Behavior Analysis revealed that the file is ransomware developed using the Golang language. TTC-CERT suspects the attackers chose Golang because its source code can be compiled into binaries for various operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS, saving development time.  Furthermore, malware compiled with the Golang compiler can run on target machines with minimal reliance on operating system APIs, increasing the likelihood of successful attacks while leaving fewer traces compared to scripting languages like Python.\n\nThis ransomware is configured to target specific victims and has various capabilities beyond encrypting files on the target machine.  It can also encrypt files stored on network drives connected to the target computer and directs victims to pay the ransom through the attacker's website on the Tor network.\n\nOther capabilities identified through behavior analysis include the ability to accept parameters from Registry Keys, resulting in different behaviors based on the defined parameters.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 396/66 (IT) Thursday, August 31, 2023. VMware has released software updates to address two security vulnerabilities in Aria Operations for Networks that could be exploited to bypass authentication and allow remote code execution. The most severe vulnerability, CVE-2023-34039 (CVSS score: 9.8), is an authentication bypass vulnerability that allows attackers with network access to Aria Operations for Networks to bypass SSH authentication to access the Aria Operations for Networks CLI. The vulnerability was reported by researchers Harsh Jaiswal and Rahul Maini, who are credited with its discovery.  The second vulnerability, CVE-2023-20890 (CVSS score: 7.2), is an arbitrary file write vulnerability affecting Aria Operations for Networks. It could be exploited by attackers with admin privileges to write files to arbitrary locations and achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability was reported by Sina Kheirkhah of the Summoning team.  These vulnerabilities affect VMware Aria Operations Networks versions 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5.1, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, and 6.10.

This groundbreaking piece of legislation represents a major step towards achieving a common level of cybersecurity across the Union.\nDSPs are the owners or administrators of the underlying systems currently called either Internet or Digital Society.\nAlongside telecom providers, DSPs make the digital infrastructure available to operators of essential services. It is therefore reasonable to believe that they play an important role in assuring the cybersecurity of our digital market, ergo they will be the first ones required to adopt measures. Recitals 35 and 44 of the NIS Directive provide valuable insights in this respect.

Spearphishing via service is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of third party services rather than directly via enterprise email channels. \nAll forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services.\n These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise. As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with the target or get the target's interest in some way. Adversaries will create fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities. Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and software that's running in an environment. The adversary can then send malicious links or attachments through these services.\nA common example is to build rapport with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail service that the target uses on their work computer. This allows an adversary to bypass some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more likely to open the file since it's something they were expecting.

A remote attack occurred via pagers used by the Hezbollah group in Lebanon and Syria, resulting in at least 9 deaths and more than 2,800 injuries. This incident occurred simultaneously across Lebanon and is believed to be an attack targeting pagers used by Hezbollah for covert communication to avoid tracking by Israeli intelligence. One of the deceased is the child of a Hezbollah member of parliament, while the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon was slightly injured. The exploded pagers are the latest model recently adopted by Hezbollah. Experts believe this may be a Supply Chain Attack, where the pagers might have been modified before delivery to detonate when remotely controlled. CNN reported that the pagers may have been tampered with during manufacturing or transportation, leading to this attack. Although there is no official confirmation of the cause, many experts emphasize that devices using lithium-ion batteries do not have such an explosion risk.

In September 2021, Microsoft reported a large-scale phishing campaign which such a service could facilitate, offering numerous templates for buyers. The service also collected all credentials stolen by members (1,618 at the time) from phishing attacks. With assistance from the Australian Federal Police and the FBI, Malaysian police were able to operate and disrupt several domains used by the illicit storefront. Police arrested eight suspects on November 6. Officials also seized digital wallets worth approximately $213,000, servers, computers, jewelry, vehicles, and payment cards.  With the servers seized, law enforcement can examine them to identify users of the platform, some of whom paid a $2,000 monthly subscription fee to access the logs.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-44000, has a CVSS score of 7.5 and could allow unauthenticated attackers to take control of user accounts and escalate privileges to administrator. The flaw is caused by a cookie leak in WordPress debug log files, which allows attackers to use this information to log into the website with a valid user session. However, this vulnerability only occurs when the debug feature is enabled, which is disabled by default in WordPress.  For mitigation, users should update the LiteSpeed Cache plugin to version 6.5.0.1, which addresses this issue.

The Akira ransomware is Windows ransomware with a 64-bit Windows binary, written in C++ and using the Boost library for asynchronous cryptographic operations. The authors used Microsoft Linker version 14.35. Attacks began in March 2023, with hackers behind the malware claiming to have breached several organizations across multiple industries, including education, finance, and real estate.\n\nDecryption method: The first step is to download the Avast decryptor binary, which is a 64-bit decryptor as the ransomware itself is 64-bit and won't run on 32-bit Windows. If you have no choice but to use 32-bit applications, you can download a 32-bit decryptor. Avast released both a 64-bit and a 32-bit Windows decryptor.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 372/67 (IT) Tuesday, October 22, 2024. Researchers from ETH Zurich discovered serious encryption problems in cloud storage platforms using end-to-end encryption (E2EE), which could lead to the leakage of sensitive user data.  This report indicates that 5 major providers, such as Sync, pCloud, Icedrive, Seafile, and Tresorit, all have vulnerabilities found in their cloud storage processes. Researchers Jonas Hofmann and Kien Tuong Truong explained that \"malicious servers could be used to interfere with or modify file data, including accessing user data in plain text.\"  The vulnerabilities found involve various attack methods such as file insertion, metadata modification, and authentication bypass, impacting the confidentiality and security of user data. Furthermore, these attacks do not require advanced cryptographic skills, making them easy to execute even by attackers with limited resources.  Sync, pCloud, Seafile, and Tresorit have acknowledged the report and are working on fixes. Icedrive, however, has chosen not to take action, despite the disclosure in late April 2024.  This discovery highlights the importance of auditing and improving encryption systems in cloud platforms to prevent future cyberattacks from malicious actors.

The vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-10542 and CVE-2024-10781, have a CVSS severity score of 9.8. Both vulnerabilities have been patched in versions 6.44 and 6.45, released this month.  The CleanTalk plugin is installed on over 200,000 WordPress websites and blocks spam from comments and forms. However, if attackers can install plugins, it could lead to remote attacks, especially if those plugins have unpatched vulnerabilities. Updating plugins and the WordPress system is crucial for mitigating this risk.  Additionally, Sucuri has warned of multiple attack campaigns using compromised WordPress websites to redirect users to phishing sites, steal data, install malware, or run PHP code on the server, further increasing system risk.

The Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 391/66 (IT) on Tuesday, August 29, 2023, reported that an updated version of the KmsdBot botnet malware is targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices. KmsdBot was first documented by a security company in November 2022.  It was designed to target private servers and cloud hosting providers.  The malware is designed to scan random IP addresses for open SSH ports and brute-force the systems with a list of passwords downloaded from attacker-controlled servers.  This new update has the capability to scan Telnet and supports more architectures found in IoT devices.  The Telnet attacks are carried out by downloading a text file (telnet.txt) containing a list of weak, commonly used passwords and combinations for various applications. It exploits the fact that many IoT devices still have default credentials and have not been changed.

Use of MFA is recommended and provides a higher level of security than usernames and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms. \nIf a smart card is used for multi-factor authentication, then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use. With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token. \nAdversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID. Capturing token input (including a user's personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e. replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given access to both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended temporary codes). \nOther methods of MFA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate. It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS). If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception. Service providers can also be targeted: for example, an adversary may compromise an SMS messaging service in order to steal MFA codes sent to users’ phones.\n URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1111", "2017", 1]

The Helldown ransomware group is a new threat in the cyber world, targeting Linux systems and VMware ESXi used in organizations across multiple sectors.  Recent attacks reveal that the group exploits vulnerabilities in Zyxel firewall devices to gain access to victim systems. Sekoia reports that Helldown ransomware may be exploiting an undisclosed vulnerability in Zyxel firewalls. Although Zyxel has released patches, there is no clear information about the vulnerability used by the attackers. Helldown exhibits sophisticated attack behavior and focuses on stealing large amounts of data from victims, such as important documents and personal information, which are used as leverage for ransom demands. Since August, Helldown ransomware has attacked 31 victims, mostly in the United States and organizations in various sectors. Helldown also attempts to cover its tracks, such as deleting tools used and overwriting data on hard drives, to hinder the victim's data recovery process.

Typically, a defender will be able to identify the last proxy traffic traversed before it enters their network; the defender may or may not be able to identify any previous proxies before the last-hop proxy. This technique makes identifying the original source of the malicious traffic even more difficult by requiring the defender to trace malicious traffic through several proxies to identify its source.\nFor example, adversaries may construct or use onion routing networks – such as the publicly available \n network – to transport encrypted C2 traffic through a compromised population, allowing communication with any device within the network.\n Adversaries may also use operational relay box (ORB) networks composed of virtual private servers (VPS), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart devices, and end-of-life routers to obfuscate their operations. \n \nIn the case of network infrastructure, it is possible for an adversary to leverage multiple compromised devices to create a multi-hop proxy chain (i.e., \n). By leveraging \n on routers, adversaries can add custom code to the affected network devices that will implement onion routing between those nodes. This method is dependent upon the \n method allowing the adversaries to cross the protected network boundary of the Internet perimeter and into the organization’s Wide-Area Network (WAN).  Protocols such as ICMP may be used as a transport.  \nSimilarly, adversaries may abuse peer-to-peer (P2P) and blockchain-oriented infrastructure to implement routing between a decentralized network of peers.\n URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003/", "2020", 1]

DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.  \nDLL injection is commonly performed by writing the path to a DLL in the virtual address space of the target process before loading the DLL by invoking a new thread. The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as \n and \n, then invoked with \n (which calls the \n API responsible for loading the DLL). \n \nVariations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue as well as the additional APIs to invoke execution (since these methods load and execute the files in memory by manually preforming the function of \n).\n \nAnother variation of this method, often referred to as Module Stomping/Overloading or DLL Hollowing, may be leveraged to conceal injected code within a process. This method involves loading a legitimate DLL into a remote process then manually overwriting the module's \n before starting a new thread in the target process.\n This variation allows attackers to hide malicious injected code by potentially backing its execution with a legitimate DLL file on disk.\n \nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via DLL injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. \n URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/001/", "2020", 1]

Hackers are exploiting a critical, unpatched vulnerability in the WordPress plugin, tracked as CVE-2023-3460 (CVSS score: 9.8), to create rogue administrator accounts.  Ultimate Member is a popular WordPress membership plugin that allows administrators to create advanced online communities and membership sites. It allows the creation of almost any type of website where users can join and become members easily.  The plugin is currently installed on over 200,000 sites.\n\nResearchers at WordPress security firm WPScan noticed new administrator accounts kept appearing on targeted websites. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to create new user accounts with administrator privileges, which can be used to completely take over the website. Researchers explain that the root cause of the issue is the use of a pre-defined list of user meta data keys that users should not be able to manipulate. The plugin uses this list to check if users are trying to register these keys when creating a new account. This security mechanism is considered unsafe.\n\nWPScan didn't provide details about the exploit but shared Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) for these attacks.

Ensure that governance aspects are derived from business processes and protection requirements, and are defined before dealing with technology.\n2. End-user involvement can effectively mitigate risks. Awareness-raising on COIT programmes is highly effective for the enforcement of security policies.\n3. Periodic risk assessment on COIT programmes should be undertaken to ensure that security policies remain compatible with evolving technologies.\n4. Keep in mind that encryption complements but does not replace strategic risk management within a COIT programme.\n5. Perform small steps initially and proceed with more complex policies when sufficient experience has been gained.\n6. It is important to identify which COIT risks need to be mitigated within your organisation while the window of opportunity till remains open\nThe report builds on ’s October 2012 publication,\nConsumerization of IT: Top Risks and Opportunities\n, and was produced by  with input and comments from a group of experts from industry, academia and public sector organisations.\nFor the full report:\nConsumerization of IT: Risk Mitigation Strategies and Good Practices URL: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/security-is-key-for-byod", "2013", 0]

The Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 379/66 (IT) reported on Friday, August 18, 2023, that cybersecurity firm Cofense has discovered a QR code phishing campaign targeting leading energy companies in the United States to steal users' Microsoft credentials across multiple industries.  Most links included in the phishing messages contain Bing redirect URLs. Other prominent domains include krxd[.]com (linked to Salesforce applications) and cf-ipfs[.]com (Cloudflare's Web3 service).  Using QR codes offers advantages over embedding phishing links directly in emails, most importantly the ability to bypass anti-phishing solutions, as the phishing link is hidden within the QR code image. Researchers observed a monthly growth percentage for this campaign exceeding 270%. The overall campaign has grown by more than 2,400% since May 2023. Researchers say this is the largest campaign ever using QR codes observed by Cofense, a situation suggesting that attackers are testing the effectiveness of QR codes. The phishing messages used in this campaign contain a PNG image file or a PDF file with a QR code. The message content attempts to trick recipients into scanning the code to verify their account.  The email message urges recipients to complete the process within 2-3 days. Experts warn that the energy sector is the main focus of this campaign, followed by the manufacturing and insurance sectors.

Cybersecurity researcher Patrick Wardle has revealed the latest campaign by North Korean-backed hackers, known for scamming victims with fake job postings. This time, they're using a new version of the BeaverTail malware to trick macOS users into downloading a malicious version of Microtalk, a video call service.  Wardle explains in his report that the attackers lure victims into downloading a Microtalk update file infected with BeaverTail malware by asking them to participate in a job interview. \"Even though the fake website states 'you can start your next video chat with a single click, without downloading anything,' some users may not read all the details,\" Wardle said.  In addition to stealing data from victims' devices, BeaverTail malware can also load additional malware onto the system, including InvisibleFerret.  The report adds that North Korean hackers are skilled at targeting macOS users with social engineering attacks.  The campaign demonstrates the development of new techniques and methods by North Korean hackers to deceive and attack users, especially in the context of job searches and interviews.

When designing and developing a software solution, it is important to keep these distinctions in mind. A user who has been authenticated (perhaps by providing a username and password) is often not authorized to access every resource and perform every action that is technically possible through a system. For example, a web app may have both regular users and admins, with the admins being able to perform actions the average user is not privileged to do so, even though they have been authenticated. Additionally, authentication is not always required for accessing resources; an unauthenticated user may be authorized to access certain public resources, such as an image or login page, or even an entire web app. URL: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html", "2xxx", 1]

For example, in Microsoft Active Directory (AD) environments, this may be used to forge \n without the need to compromise the signing certificate to forge new credentials. Instead, an adversary can manipulate domain trusts to add their own signing certificate. An adversary may also convert an AD domain to a federated domain using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), which may enable malicious trust modifications such as altering the claim issuance rules to log in any valid set of credentials as a specified user.\n \nAn adversary may also add a new federated identity provider to an identity tenant such as Okta or AWS IAM Identity Center, which may enable the adversary to authenticate as any user of the tenant.\n This may enable the threat actor to gain broad access into a variety of cloud-based services that leverage the identity tenant. For example, in AWS environments, an adversary that creates a new identity provider for an AWS Organization will be able to federate into all of the AWS Organization member accounts without creating identities for each of the member accounts.\n URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/002/", "2020", 1]

When a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource it will automatically attempt to authenticate and send credential information for the current user to the remote system. \n This behavior is typical in enterprise environments so that users do not need to enter credentials to access network resources.\nWeb Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is also typically used by Windows systems as a backup protocol when SMB is blocked or fails. WebDAV is an extension of HTTP and will typically operate over TCP ports 80 and 443. \n \nAdversaries may take advantage of this behavior to gain access to user account hashes through forced SMB/WebDAV authentication. An adversary can send an attachment to a user through spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external server controlled by the adversary (i.e. \n), or place a specially crafted file on navigation path for privileged accounts (e.g. .SCF file placed on desktop) or on a publicly accessible share to be accessed by victim(s). When the user's system accesses the untrusted resource it will attempt authentication and send information, including the user's hashed credentials, over SMB to the adversary controlled server. \n With access to the credential hash, an adversary can perform off-line \n cracking to gain access to plaintext credentials. \nThere are several different ways this can occur. \n Some specifics from in-the-wild use include:\n URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1187", "2018", 1]

To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file.

Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (\n for Windows and \n for Linux and macOS).\nOn Linux and Mac, users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a \".\" as the first character in the file or folder name  \n \n. Files and folders that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like \"ls\". Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.\nFiles on macOS can also be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app \n. On Windows, users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known hosts and keys.\nAdversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.\n URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/001/", "2020", 1]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 402/67 (IT) Wednesday, November 13, 2024. Kaspersky researchers discovered a new type of ransomware called Ymir being used in attacks alongside the RustyStealer malware, a data-stealing program that infiltrates victim systems before deploying the ransomware.  Ymir attacks networks containing sensitive information, with RustyStealer utilizing techniques to collect credentials and gain system access through privileged accounts. Once installed, Ymir encrypts system files and creates a ransom note in a PDF file to coerce payment.  It also modifies Windows settings to display warning messages on the login screen to further pressure victims into complying with the hackers' demands.  Ymir ransomware operates stealthily by running in memory and uses ChaCha20 encryption, an advanced encryption algorithm, to encrypt data, making decryption difficult.  The malware also scans the system for signs of PowerShell and deletes itself to avoid detection in its final stages. Currently, no data leak site associated with Ymir has been found, suggesting that the attackers may be in the early stages of victim data collection.  If this ransomware evolves to include data exfiltration capabilities, it could become an even more dangerous threat.

Breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.\nDevices such as routers and firewalls can be used to create boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks.  They achieve this by restricting traffic types to enforce organizational policy in an attempt to reduce the risk inherent in such connections.  Restriction of traffic can be achieved by prohibiting IP addresses, layer 4 protocol ports, or through deep packet inspection to identify applications.  To participate with the rest of the network, these devices can be directly addressable or transparent, but their mode of operation has no bearing on how the adversary can bypass them when compromised.\nWhen an adversary takes control of such a boundary device, they can bypass its policy enforcement to pass normally prohibited traffic across the trust boundary between the two separated networks without hinderance.  By achieving sufficient rights on the device, an adversary can reconfigure the device to allow the traffic they want, allowing them to then further achieve goals such as command and control via \n or exfiltration of data via \n.

The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths. Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with \n, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable.  Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the \n function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present. Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.\nAdversaries may gain execution by inserting malicious dylibs with the name of the missing dylib in the identified path.\n Dylibs are loaded into an application's address space allowing the malicious dylib to inherit the application's privilege level and resources. Based on the application, this could result in privilege escalation and uninhibited network access.

Hadooken's capabilities include installing cryptocurrency mining software (cryptominer) and deploying Tsunami malware, which can be used for later system breaches.  This attack targets WebLogic servers, developed by Oracle and often used in large organizations. Attackers gain access to the servers through weak passwords.

The Ministry later announced that some critical systems were restored, such as the Kuwait Cancer Control Center system, and management systems related to health insurance and health checks for foreigners.  The Ministry's technical team traced the problem to an attempted system breach that caused the disruption. The Ministry is collaborating with government security agencies to control the situation and implement additional measures to enhance the security of its infrastructure.  It acted swiftly to prevent the spread of the threat and protect access to the Ministry's critical databases. While details about the attack are still unclear, based on the measures taken, it is suspected that the Ministry might be facing a ransomware attack.  No ransomware group has claimed responsibility yet.\n\n URL: https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/09/30/%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%b0%e0%b8%97%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%a7%e0%b8%87%e0%b8%aa%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%98%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%93%e0%b8%aa%e0%b8%b8%e0%b8%82%e0%b8%84%e0%b8%b9%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%a7%e0%b8%95%e0%b9%80/", "2024", 0]

Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.\nIf the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs can elevate privileges or execute some elevated \n objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box.\n An example of this is use of \n to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated \n object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user.\nMany methods have been discovered to bypass UAC.

Cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies has revealed phishing attacks attempting to exploit a vulnerability in the open-source webmail software Roundcube. Although Roundcube is not the most popular software, many government agencies still use it, making it a prime target for hackers. The attack begins with an email that appears to have no content, but contains hidden JavaScript code that allows hackers to access sensitive information. It exploits the vulnerability CVE-2024-37383, a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) security issue. Attackers can trick victims into opening a specially crafted email, causing JavaScript code to run that can access sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. This information is then sent to a server controlled by the hackers, hosted on Cloudflare. Currently, it is not clear who is behind the attacks, but Positive Technologies points out that hacker groups APT28, Winter Vivern, and TAG-70 have previously used similar vulnerabilities in Roundcube.

When the product communicates with outside parties, details about the underlying system are expected to remain hidden, such as path names for data files, other OS users, installed packages, the application environment, etc. This system information may be provided by the product itself, or buried within diagnostic or debugging messages. Debugging information helps an adversary learn about the system and form an attack plan.\nAn information exposure occurs when system data or debugging information leaves the program through an output stream or logging function that makes it accessible to unauthorized parties. Using other weaknesses, an attacker could cause errors to occur; the response to these errors can reveal detailed system information, along with other impacts. An attacker can use messages that reveal technologies, operating systems, and product versions to tune the attack against known vulnerabilities in these technologies. A product may use diagnostic methods that provide significant implementation details such as stack traces as part of its error handling mechanism.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhases: Architecture and Design; Implementation\nProduction applications should never use methods that generate internal details such as stack traces and error messages unless that information is directly committed to a log that is not viewable by the end user.

Security researchers have released a new toolkit designed to help victims of Black Basta Ransomware. This toolkit can recover stolen files.  SR Labs Research revealed in a recent GitHub post that these tools exploit a weakness in Black Basta's encryption algorithm. Analysis indicates that files can be recovered, whether fully or partially, depending on the file size. Files smaller than 5,000 bytes cannot be recovered.  Files between 5,000 bytes and 1GB can be fully recovered. For files larger than 1GB, the first 5,000 bytes will be lost, but the rest can be recovered.  The tool works when Black Basta encrypts files with only zeros, which is why it only works with larger files. However, the decryption tool will only work with Black Basta Ransomware used in attacks around April 2023.

A high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2024-43405) with a CVSS score of 7.4 has been identified in Nuclei, an open-source vulnerability scanner.  This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass signature verification and inject malicious code into templates.  The Wiz team reported that the vulnerability stems from differing newline character handling between signature verification and YAML parser data conversion, enabling attackers to insert malicious content while maintaining valid signatures in the normal section.\n\nNuclei supports various protocols, including HTTP, TCP, DNS, and Code, which can execute code on the operating system.  Using unsafe templates could lead to system compromise.  Wiz's report demonstrates that the \"Code\" protocol can be used to extract sensitive information from target systems if weaponized with malicious code.\n\nThis vulnerability affects Nuclei versions 3.0.0 and later and has been patched in version v3.3.2.  Users should verify templates before use to prevent malicious code injection.

On Monday, Google announced the cancellation of its plan to phase out third-party cookies in the Chrome web browser, which began more than 4 years ago under the Privacy Sandbox project. This is in response to numerous privacy concerns. Anthony Chavez, Vice President at Google, said the company will launch a new experience in Chrome that allows users to choose to use cookies as needed and can change that option at any time.  Google is consulting with regulators and will collaborate with the industry in implementing this change.  Although browsers like Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox have not supported third-party cookies since early 2020, Google continues to face difficulties in doing so due to its significant role in the online advertising market.  Efforts to balance privacy and ad support have met with intense scrutiny from regulators and privacy advocates.  This change comes just months after Google announced its plan to phase out third-party cookies again, which has been postponed several times due to concerns about fair competition in the digital advertising market.

In this incident, Cumbria Police admitted that the names, salaries, and allowances of officers were indeed published on its website due to an unintentional human error.  The information was removed immediately after the accidental publication, but the police did not specify how long the data was online before the error was discovered. Cumbria Constabulary stated it had immediately contacted all affected officers to inform them of the minor impact and outline the measures being taken to manage the leak and prevent recurrence.  The incident was reported to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO – the UK's data regulator), which reportedly stated that no further action was needed beyond advice and guidance.

TEG (Ticketek Entertainment Group) is an Australian company operating in the live entertainment and ticketing industry. The company operates in several countries and sells more than 30 million tickets annually for more than 30,000 events, including live sports, concerts, theater performances, festivals, and exhibitions.  TechCrunch reported that a Threat Actor was found offering stolen customer data from TEG on a popular forum. The Threat Actor claims to have data from over 30 million users, such as names, usernames, gender, birthdays, passwords, and email addresses. They shared some sample data as proof.\n\nIn May, Ticketek disclosed a cyberattack affecting Ticketek Australia user account data. This data was stored on a cloud platform, and although Ticketek did not disclose the provider's name, experts believe it may be Snowflake.

This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.\nOrdered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.\nSticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.\nIn addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Implementation\nIf the application only requires communication with its own components, then the destination is always known, and an explicit intent could be used.\n URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/927.html", "2013", 1]

The Canadian government has ordered TikTok, owned by ByteDance in China, to cease operations in the country.  The decision is stated to be the result of a national security risk assessment.  The review was conducted by Canada’s security and intelligence community. The government emphasized that it will not restrict access to TikTok for the general Canadian public, but advised citizens to assess the potential risks of using the social media app.  François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, stated that the government wants citizens to be aware of the risks of using social media platforms, particularly in terms of data management and security related to foreign countries. TikTok has been banned on government devices since February 2023.  TikTok responded that closing the office in Canada will result in hundreds of employees being laid off.  The company intends to challenge this order in court.  In a statement, ByteDance confirmed that no user data will be shared with the Chinese government. However, concerns remain that TikTok may be forced to hand over user data. This has resulted in the U.S. enacting a law requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok by January 2025 or face a ban in the country. Currently, TikTok is completely banned in several countries, including Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, and is prohibited on government-issued devices in many countries around the world.

File systems provide a structure to store and access data from physical storage.

Hidden file systems, sometimes referred to as virtual file systems, can be implemented in numerous ways. One implementation would be to store a file system in reserved disk space unused by disk structures or standard file system partitions.\n Another implementation could be for an adversary to drop their own portable partition image as a file on top of the standard file system.\n Adversaries may also fragment files across the existing file system structure in non-standard ways.\n URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/005/", "2020", 1]

WinRAR, a file compression and archiving utility for Windows operating systems, was affected by a high-severity vulnerability, now patched, designated CVE-2023-40477 (CVSS score 7.8).  This vulnerability could allow remote code execution on a computer by opening a specially crafted RAR archive.  The vulnerability was reported to RARLAB by Zero Day Initiative researcher \"goodbyeselene\" on June 8, 2023, and could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a RARLAB WinRAR installation. User interaction is required for exploitation. Targets may be tricked into visiting malicious websites or opening malicious files.  The vulnerability is due to a lack of validation of user-supplied data, which can result in out-of-bounds memory access.  This allows attackers to execute code by exploiting this vulnerability. WinRAR addressed the vulnerability with the release of version 6.23. Users are advised to update their WinRAR installations before attackers can exploit the vulnerability.

The report aims to bridge the gap between the legal framework and the available technological implementation measures. It provides an inventory of the existing approaches and privacy design strategies, and the technical building blocks of various degree of maturity from research and development. Limitations and inherent constraints are presented with recommendations for their mitigation.\nThe study, targeted at data protection authorities, policy makers, regulaltors, engineers and researchers, offers an insight into the technological aspect of the current state of the art. It presents the challenges and limitations of by-design principles for privacy and data protection, acts as a reference guide, and intends to improve the effectiveness of future policy in the area.\nThe main challenges identified in the report are two fold:\nExisting policy doesn’t offer a guarantee for compliance with privacy by design. New policy should give incentives for adopting privacy by design.\nNew standards for electronic communication need to consider privacy and data protection, while privacy and data protection-ignorant standards should be out-phased.\nFurthermore, privacy by design needs to be linked with the practice taking usability into account.\nFor the full report:\nPrivacy and Data Protection by Design - from policy to engineering\nBackground:\nPrivacy constitutes a core value of individuals and democratic societies. Decades of debate have gone into the manner of embedding these values and legal obligations into systems, preferably from the beginning of the design process.

The Ugandan government confirmed on Thursday that the country's central bank was hit by a cyberattack by financially motivated threat actors, resulting in a significant loss of funds. The attack is under investigation by the Criminal Investigations Directorate (CID) of the police and the Office of the Auditor General (OAG).  Henry Musasizi, the junior finance minister, revealed in parliament that some central bank accounts were hacked. However, the losses might not be as severe as reported in some media outlets. He added that the bank has undertaken a thorough account reconciliation and investigation into the incident. The Bank of Uganda indicated that the attack involved a threat actor group called “Waste,” believed to be operating from Southeast Asia. The group moved 62 billion Ugandan shillings (approximately $16.8 million) to foreign accounts in early November. According to local media reports, some of the money was transferred to accounts in Japan and the United Kingdom. Authorities in the UK were able to seize more than $7 million, although some had already been withdrawn. In Japan, the attackers reportedly received about $6 million. The central bank has managed to recover some of the funds. The investigation is ongoing to identify those involved and to implement preventive measures for the future.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 352/67 (IT) Monday, October 7, 2024.  A recent discovery reveals a high-severity vulnerability in the LiteSpeed Cache plugin on WordPress, which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. This vulnerability is identified as CVE-2024-47374 and has a CVSS severity score of 7.2, affecting versions up to 6.5.0.2 of the plugin with over 6 million installations. The vulnerability stems from a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) issue that allows attackers to steal sensitive information or escalate privileges on WordPress websites by performing a single HTTP request. If certain settings are enabled, such as “CSS Combine” and “Generate UCSS,” this vulnerability could allow attackers to take control of the entire website.  LiteSpeed Cache is a popular plugin used in WordPress for website acceleration and is often used with popular plugins like WooCommerce and Yoast SEO, making it highly vulnerable to attacks. A fix for this vulnerability was released in version 6.5.1 on September 25, 2024. Website administrators should update immediately to prevent attacks from malicious actors. In addition, the developers also fixed another vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-44000, which allowed attackers to access cookie information and escalate privileges to administrator level.  This vulnerability was fixed in version 6.5.0.1 of the plugin.

If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.\nAn adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.\nThe ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.\nAdversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 73/67 (IT) Thursday, February 22, 2024. Joomla, an open-source content management system (CMS), has multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution (RCE) attacks. The Sonar vulnerability research team discovered one of the underlying vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2024-21726, which is significant because it affects Joomla's core filtering component. Attackers can exploit this XSS vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into a victim's website. Attackers can steal visitor data, perform malicious redirects, or infect users with malware. In this case, attackers could cause problems by tricking an administrator into clicking a malicious link.

These vulnerabilities were discovered by Synack Red Team researchers. ScrutisWeb allows organizations to monitor bank or retail ATMs from a web browser, enabling quick responses to issues. Synack researchers identified four vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-33871, CVE-2023-38257, CVE-2023-35763, and CVE-2023-35189.  The vulnerabilities include authorization bypass, hardcoded cryptographic key, and arbitrary file upload, which could be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers. Attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities to obtain information from the server (configuration, logs, and databases) and execute arbitrary commands.  Researchers said attackers could leverage these vulnerabilities to log into the ScrutisWeb management console as an administrator, monitor the activity of connected ATMs, enable management mode on the devices, upload files, and reboot or shut down the machines.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 310/66 (IT) Tuesday, June 20, 2023.  In February, the online news platform Reddit experienced a security breach where attackers gained unauthorized access to internal documents, code, and some business systems.  The company announced that it was affected by the attack, which occurred on February 5, 2023. The phishing attack impacted company employees. The company clarified that Reddit user passwords and accounts were not accessed. The spear-phishing attack targeted employees by redirecting them to a fake company website. The landing page was designed to trick employees into entering their credentials and tokens. Once the employees' credentials were obtained, the attackers were able to access internal documents, code, as well as internal dashboards and some business systems. The company's main systems were not accessed.  The BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware group claimed responsibility for the February cyberattack, stating that they stole 80GB of data from Reddit.

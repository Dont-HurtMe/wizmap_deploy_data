Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 93/67 (IT) reported on Friday, March 8, 2024, that financial organizations in Vietnam have been targeted by a new cyber attacker group called Lotus Bane. This is part of a cyber attack first detected in March 2023. Group-IB said that this is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group, believed to have been active since 2022. The exact specifics of the attack patterns are still unknown. Group-IB explains that the techniques used by Lotus Bane overlap with OceanLotus, a Vietnamese threat group also known as APT32, Canvas Cyclone (formerly Bismuth), and Cobalt Kitty. This stems from the use of malware such as PIPEDANCE.  It is worth noting that PIPEDANCE was first documented by Elastic Security Labs in February 2023, linked to cyber attacks targeting an unnamed organization in Vietnam in late December 2022. The Lotus Bane group was involved in the attack, primarily targeting the banking sector in the APAC region. Although the attacks took place in Vietnam, their sophisticated methods indicate the potential for attacks on other countries within the APAC group.  Ongoing investigations may shed more light on their origins. The presence and activities of the Lotus Bane group in the APAC region highlight the need for continuous vigilance and strong cybersecurity measures.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/03/08/lotus-bane-%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%b8%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%a1-apt-%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a1%e0%b9%88-%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%b9%e0%b9%88%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%9a%e0%b8%b7%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%87/", "2024", 0]

Researchers found that a hacker group linked to the North Korean government used job scams to penetrate the energy and space industries. They spread new malware called MISTPEN, a previously undiscovered backdoor. Cybersecurity firm Mandiant stated that the group, known as UNC2970 or Lazarus Group, uses tactics impersonating recruiters from leading companies to trick managers or senior executives into opening files containing hidden malware, particularly in the energy and space industries in several countries, including the US, UK, and Singapore. This attack starts by sending emails or WhatsApp messages, tricking victims into opening ZIP files that appear to be job-related documents.  But when these PDF files are opened, they require the use of a modified Sumatra PDF program to inject malware into the victim's system. MISTPEN is malware designed to be installed on the system and controlled via a command-and-control server.

A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.\nDifferent ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.\n With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed. Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.\nACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists. When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets. This greatly reduces the resources available for providing the targeted service.\n https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/001/", "2020", 1]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 342/66 (IT) Wednesday, July 12, 2023. In early 2022, attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Revolut's payment system to steal over $20 million, according to the Financial Times, citing multiple sources.  The breach was not publicly disclosed.  The issue stemmed from a flaw in Revolut's system in America and Europe, causing some transactions to be declined. The company would then refund the accounts using its own funds. The problem was first discovered in late 2022, with reports indicating that attackers exploited the vulnerability by attempting to purchase expensive items that would be declined. The refunded amounts were then withdrawn from ATMs.  Technical details of the vulnerability remain unclear.  Approximately $23 million was stolen, with a portion recovered by tracking down those who withdrew the cash. The massive fraud resulted in the neobank and fintech company incurring a net loss of around $20 million.

The university's data breach announcement stated that the incident affected only a portion of applicants and that a preliminary investigation found no evidence that student, staff, or alumni data was affected.  The university said it is still in the process of reviewing the data accessed by the attackers and is asking all international applicants to follow the advice provided on the university's website. Earlier this week, the University of Michigan announced the shutdown of systems critical to its operations to address a serious cybersecurity incident. In June, the University of Manchester suffered a data breach in which hackers stole a quantity of data from its network.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2023/09/05/%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%a7%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%97%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%a2-sydney-%e0%b9%84%e0%b8%94%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%96%e0%b8%b9%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%b0%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%a1/", "2023", 0]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 109/67 (IT) Wednesday, March 20, 2024.  31-year-old Sandu Boris Diaconu was sentenced to 42 months in prison in the U.S. for operating an illegal marketplace called E-Root Marketplace, which offered 350,000 stolen credentials for sale. He was charged with conspiracy to commit access device fraud and computer fraud, and possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices. He pleaded guilty on December 1, 2023.  The E-Root Marketplace operated through a widely distributed network and was able to hide the identities of administrators, buyers, and sellers. Buyers could search for compromised computer credentials on E-Root, such as usernames and passwords, that would allow buyers to remotely access computers for the purpose of stealing personal information or manipulating computer content remotely. The marketplace also concealed transaction paths by using an online payment system called Perfect Money, which allowed Bitcoin to be converted to Perfect Money.  The infrastructure associated with E-Root and Perfect Money was seized by law enforcement in late 2020.  It is estimated that more than 350,000 credentials were advertised for sale in the illegal marketplace, with many victims falling under ransomware attacks and tax fraud schemes.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/03/20/%e0%b8%9c%e0%b8%b9%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%94%e0%b8%b9%e0%b9%81%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%b0%e0%b8%9a%e0%b8%9a-e-root-marketplace-%e0%b8%96%e0%b8%b9%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%95%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%94%e0%b8%aa%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%99/", "9999", 0]

These can be maintained in a number of ways. For example, Microsoft Entra ID includes three options for synchronizing identities between Active Directory and Entra ID\n:\nAD FS can also be used with other SaaS and cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP, which will hand off the authentication process to AD FS and receive a token containing the hybrid users’ identity and privileges. \nBy modifying authentication processes tied to hybrid identities, an adversary may be able to establish persistent privileged access to cloud resources. For example, adversaries who compromise an on-premises server running a PTA agent may inject a malicious DLL into the \n process that authorizes all attempts to authenticate to Entra ID, as well as records user credentials.\n In environments using AD FS, an adversary may edit the \n configuration file to load a malicious DLL that generates authentication tokens for any user with any set of claims, thereby bypassing multi-factor authentication and defined AD FS policies.\nIn some cases, adversaries may be able to modify the hybrid identity authentication process from the cloud. For example, adversaries who compromise a Global Administrator account in an Entra ID tenant may be able to register a new PTA agent via the web console, similarly allowing them to harvest credentials and log into the Entra ID environment as any user.\n https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/007/", "2022", 1]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 297/67 (IT) Wednesday, August 21, 2024. The new ransomware group Mad Liberator is a threat group to watch out for after Sophos X-Ops discovered that the group is using the remote access application AnyDesk to attack users. They create fake Microsoft Windows update screens to conceal data theft from users. Mad Liberator has been operating since July 2024, focusing more on data theft than encryption attacks, the typical pattern of common ransomware. The group uses social engineering techniques to trick victims into allowing AnyDesk connections by misleading them into thinking it is maintenance from the company's IT department. Once the attackers establish a connection, they transfer files disguised as Windows updates into the victim's system. This fake update screen helps conceal data theft from OneDrive and files on the central server. This attack takes about four hours. The attack underscores the importance of training employees on managing remote sessions and using Anydesk access controls to prevent future attacks.  However, the social engineering tactics used by this group in the case described above are interesting but not unique. Attackers will continue to develop and use various tactics to try to exploit both the human element and technical security layers.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/08/21/%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%b8%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%a1%e0%b9%81%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%8b%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%a1%e0%b9%81%e0%b8%a7%e0%b8%a3%e0%b9%8c-mad-liberator-%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%88%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%95%e0%b8%b5/", "2024", 0]

The company says its initial analysis found that the leak will affect all major telecommunications providers because the leak of personally identifiable information (PII) poses a significant risk to both individuals and organizations, which can lead to financial loss, identity theft, reputational damage, and the possibility of cyberattacks.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/01/31/%e0%b8%9e%e0%b8%9a%e0%b8%82%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%b9%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%9c%e0%b8%b9%e0%b9%89%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%87%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%99%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%97%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%a8%e0%b8%b1/", "2024", 0]

Hackers are exploiting a critical, unpatched vulnerability in the WordPress plugin, tracked as CVE-2023-3460 (CVSS score: 9.8), to create rogue administrator accounts.  Ultimate Member is a popular WordPress membership plugin that allows administrators to create advanced online communities and membership sites. It allows the creation of almost any type of website where users can join and become members easily.  The plugin is currently installed on over 200,000 sites.\n\nResearchers at WordPress security firm WPScan noticed new administrator accounts kept appearing on targeted websites. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to create new user accounts with administrator privileges, which can be used to completely take over the website. Researchers explain that the root cause of the issue is the use of a pre-defined list of user meta data keys that users should not be able to manipulate. The plugin uses this list to check if users are trying to register these keys when creating a new account. This security mechanism is considered unsafe.\n\nWPScan didn't provide details about the exploit but shared Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) for these attacks.

It then tricks users into enabling accessibility permissions and takes complete control of the device.\" Zanubis, originally documented in August 2022, is the latest addition to a long list of Android banking Trojans targeting the Latin American (LATAM) region. Targets include more than 40 banks and financial institutions in Peru. It is primarily known for abusing accessibility permissions on infected devices to display fake overlay screens on top of target apps in an attempt to steal credentials. It can also collect contact information, installed app lists, and system metadata. Kaspersky said it observed the latest Zanubis samples in April 2023, masquerading as the Peruvian customs and tax authority application, Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria (SUNAT).

There are many ways an adversary can establish command and control with various levels of covertness, depending on system configuration and network topology. Due to the wide degree of variation available to the adversary at the network level, only the most common factors were used to describe the differences in command and control. There are still a great many specific techniques within the documented methods, largely due to how easy it is to define new protocols and use existing, legitimate protocols and network services for communication. \nThe resulting breakdown should help convey the concept that detecting intrusion through command and control protocols without prior knowledge is a difficult proposition over the long term. Adversaries' main constraints in network-level defense avoidance are testing and deployment of tools to rapidly change their protocols, awareness of existing defensive technologies, and access to legitimate Web services that, when used appropriately, make their tools difficult to distinguish from benign traffic.\nAdditionally, in the mobile environment, mobile devices are frequently connected to networks outside enterprise control such as cellular networks or public Wi-Fi networks. Adversaries could attempt to evade detection by communicating on these networks, and potentially even by using non-Internet Protocol mechanisms such as Short Message Service (SMS).

In this new strategy, Russia's cyber units are starting to focus on Ukrainian military targets instead of focusing cyberattacks on strategic civilian critical infrastructure targets. Russian officials are specifically targeting military computers and mobile phones before the summer offensive to reclaim Ukrainian territory. This change in cyber strategy stems from a shift in priorities, according to a report by the Royal United Services Institute.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 73/67 (IT) Thursday, February 22, 2024. Joomla, an open-source content management system (CMS), has multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution (RCE) attacks. The Sonar vulnerability research team discovered one of the underlying vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2024-21726, which is significant because it affects Joomla's core filtering component. Attackers can exploit this XSS vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into a victim's website. Attackers can steal visitor data, perform malicious redirects, or infect users with malware. In this case, attackers could cause problems by tricking an administrator into clicking a malicious link. Joomla powers approximately 2% of all websites, with most deployments publicly accessible, making these sites potential targets for cyber threat actors. The issue has been addressed in Joomla versions 5.0.3/4.4.3, which have been released. Therefore, users and administrators should update as soon as possible to avoid becoming victims of attackers.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/02/22/%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%87%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a7%e0%b9%88-xss-%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%99-joomla-%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%88%e0%b8%97%e0%b8%b3%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%ab%e0%b9%89%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%a7/", "2024", 0]

Last Saturday, the Israeli army penetrated the communications network of the Rafic Hariri International Airport control tower in Beirut, Lebanon, and sent warnings to Iranian civilian aircraft attempting to land, forcing the aircraft to return to Tehran, according to a report from the MiddleEastMonitor website.  The Lebanese Ministry of Transport ordered airport officials to prevent Iranian aircraft from entering Lebanese airspace after the Israeli infiltration. This decision follows warnings from the Israeli army to prevent the transport of weapons to Hezbollah through Beirut Airport.  Daniel Hagari, an Israeli army spokesperson, said in a statement: \"We will not allow the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah in any form. We are aware of arms shipments from Iran to Hezbollah, and we will act to thwart them.\"  He added: \"This airport is a civilian airport for civilian use, and it must remain so.\"  Ali Hamieh, the Lebanese Minister of Transport, confirmed to the newspaper \"An-Nahar\" that the Israeli army had penetrated the airport's control tower communication system and threatened to attack the infrastructure if Iranian planes landed.

It is present nowadays at the basis of server and desktop infrastructures, cloud computing, networking, and containerization.\nVirtualized environments are pervasively adopted and therefore increasingly becoming targets of cyber-attacks. More and more elaborated and specialized attacks are currently devised to exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses at the virtualization layer. The recent and widespread adoption of virtualization technologies has changed the traditional view of ICT, as virtualization can provide a dramatic increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of complex organizations and communities. It is also expected to constitute an important technological pillar of a thriving data-driven economy and the European single digital market.\nHowever, virtualization technologies bear a number of different security risks, some of them shared with traditional computing environments including issues affecting operating systems, communication protocols, and applications, which can be even exacerbated by the presence of virtualized components, producing a greater security impact.  On the other side, virtualization also introduces a number of specific security issues requiring ad hoc solutions.\nFull report\nis available\nonline\nFor interviews and press enquiries\nplease contact\npress@.europa.eu\nTel\n. +30 2814409576 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-study-on-the-security-aspects-of-virtualization", "2017", 0]

They rely on cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the PRNG.\nManagement of seeds could be broken down into two main areas:\n(1) protecting seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key);\n(2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from a cryptographically secure source\nPRNGs require a seed as input to generate a stream of numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from random numbers. While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space.\nSeeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered.\n\n# Migration : \n\n https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/335.html", "2006", 1]

Examples of the latter include incident reporting, the implementation of the eIDAS regulation, the proposed data protection regulation and NIS directive.\nFor example, the Agency’s recommendations on incident reporting help Member States and the private sector to enhance baseline security measures through a better understanding of the root causes and potential solutions.\nSimilarly on the eIDAS regulation, the Agency supports and provides guidelines for trust service providers on risk assessment and recommendations for incident risk mitigation, and provides guidelines on an auditing framework for trust services. Other activities in this area include analysis of relevance and compliance of standards related to TSPs; Incident reporting for Trust Service Providers; and a Strategy analysis for introduction of qualified website authentication certificates (QWACs) promoting consumer confidence in the web authentication market.  also supports the creation of a Trust Services Forum explaining to stakeholders the developments in the area of eIDAS, while offering the opportunity to discuss with regulators on important areas.\n works closely with MS and the EU Institutions and the results produced rely on the collaboration with all NIS stakeholders. ‘ is in the unique position to transfer the lessons learned across different operational communities, while promoting approaches to NIS that support economic growth’ said Udo Helmbrecht. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/udo-helmbrecht-at-the-2018information-security-for-public-sector2019-conference-in-stockholm", "2015", 0]

PyLoose is a relatively simple Python script with a compiled, base64-encoded XMRig miner, an open-source tool that leverages CPU power to solve complex algorithms necessary for the cryptocurrency.  Researchers from Wiz stated that PyLoose’s direct execution from memory makes detection by security tools difficult. Fileless malware doesn’t leave traces on the system’s drive, making it hard to detect. It typically leverages legitimate system tools to inject malicious code into legitimate processes. Wiz security researchers first detected the PyLoose attacks on June 22, 2023, and have since confirmed over 200 instances. Researchers haven't been able to attribute the PyLoose attacks to a specific threat actor, as the attackers didn't leave any clues behind.

Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.\nSearch order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. Unlike \n, the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. \n \n \n However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.\nFor example, \"example.exe\" runs \"cmd.exe\" with the command-line argument \n. An adversary may place a program called \"net.exe\" within the same directory as example.exe, \"net.exe\" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net.

The group claimed to have stolen a large amount of sensitive data from the company and threatened to publish it if the company did not contact them by a deadline of November 2, 2023, later extended to November 10, 2023.  In early November 2023, Boeing confirmed that its services division had been affected by a cyberattack and said that the investigation was ongoing. The attack targeted elements of the parts and distribution business run by the global services division, and the company reported the incident to law enforcement and relevant regulatory bodies.

Cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies has revealed phishing attacks attempting to exploit a vulnerability in the open-source webmail software Roundcube. Although Roundcube is not the most popular software, many government agencies still use it, making it a prime target for hackers. The attack begins with an email that appears to have no content, but contains hidden JavaScript code that allows hackers to access sensitive information. It exploits the vulnerability CVE-2024-37383, a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) security issue. Attackers can trick victims into opening a specially crafted email, causing JavaScript code to run that can access sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. This information is then sent to a server controlled by the hackers, hosted on Cloudflare. Currently, it is not clear who is behind the attacks, but Positive Technologies points out that hacker groups APT28, Winter Vivern, and TAG-70 have previously used similar vulnerabilities in Roundcube.

A Russian-backed hacker group targeting Ukrainian entities has been using malware for espionage. Whether accidentally or intentionally, the worm-type malware has spread to organizations in other countries. This group, known by various names such as Gamaredon, Primitive Bear, ACTINIUM, Armageddon, and Shuckworm, has been operating since at least 2014 and has been identified as a Russian state security service hacking group.  One of the tools used in the attacks against Ukraine is a worm called LitterDrifter.  This malware, written in Visual Basic Scripting, is designed to spread from one computer to another via USB drives and has two functions: to spread from USB drive to USB drive and to spread itself to devices connected to those drives.  The malware constantly communicates with command-and-control servers operated by the Gamaredon group.  The Gamaredon group focuses its attacks on various Ukrainian targets, but due to the nature of the worm, researchers have observed its spread to countries such as the United States, Vietnam, Chile, Poland, and Germany.  Researchers have also observed evidence of spread in Hong Kong. This may indicate that LitterDrifter is spreading beyond the intended targets of the Russian hackers.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2023/11/24/worm-%e0%b8%97%e0%b8%b5%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%96%e0%b8%b9%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%9b%e0%b8%a5%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%b2%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%94%e0%b8%a2%e0%b9%81%e0%b8%ae/", "2023", 0]

Experts warn of a critical Zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2023-42115 (CVSS score 9.8), in all versions of the Exim Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) software.  This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit it and execute remote code (RCE) on exposed internet servers.  The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write issue within the SMTP service, caused by a lack of validation of user-supplied data. This allows remote attackers to run arbitrary code on affected Exim installations. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.  Researchers disclosed the vulnerability via ZDI on June 6, 2022, and ZDI reported it to the vendor on June 14, 2022.

These files typically function by attaching the intended archived content to a decompressor stub that is executed when the file is invoked (e.g., \n).\n \nAdversaries may also abuse file-specific as well as custom encoding schemes. For example, Byte Order Mark (BOM) headers in text files may be abused to manipulate and obfuscate file content until \n execution.\n https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/013/", "2024", 1]

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions. \n \nWhen initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods. \n https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0890", "2021", 1]

Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system.

It uses \n of directory .LNK files that use \n to look like the real directories, which are hidden through \n. The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs. When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts. \nAdversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory. The malware may modify the original entry point (OEP) of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 287/67 (IT) Tuesday, August 13, 2024. FreeBSD has released a security update to address a critical vulnerability in OpenSSH, which could be exploited by attackers to remotely execute code with root privileges. The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2024-7589 and has a CVSS score of 7.4, indicating high severity. This vulnerability is related to signal handling in sshd (8) that may invoke unsafe logging functionality when a client fails to authenticate within the configured LoginGraceTime, which is typically 120 seconds. This process runs with root privileges, creating a risk that attackers could execute remote code. FreeBSD recommends users update OpenSSH to a supported version and restart sshd immediately to mitigate this threat. If updating is not feasible, users can reduce the risk by setting LoginGraceTime to 0 in the sshd_config file. While this increases the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, it will prevent remote code execution.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/08/13/freebsd-%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%81%e0%b9%81%e0%b8%9e%e0%b8%97%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%8c%e0%b8%94%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%a7%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%aa%e0%b8%b3%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%9a%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad/", "9999", 0]

The intention of this functionality is to bypass authentication and access control checks within the .NET application code. Authentication is done by the underlying web server (Microsoft Internet Information Service IIS), which passes the authenticated token, or unauthenticated anonymous token, to the .NET application. Using the token to impersonate the client, the application then relies on the settings within the NTFS directories and files to control access. Impersonation enables the application, on the server running the .NET application, to both execute code and access resources in the context of the authenticated and authorized user.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Operation\nRun the application with limited privilege to the underlying operating and file system.\n https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/520.html", "2006", 1]

Researchers from Patchstack have warned of a serious vulnerability in the LiteSpeed Cache plugin for WordPress, which is used by more than 5 million websites.  The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-44000, has a CVSS score of 7.5 and could allow unauthenticated attackers to take control of user accounts and escalate privileges to administrator. The flaw is caused by a cookie leak in WordPress debug log files, which allows attackers to use this information to log into the website with a valid user session. However, this vulnerability only occurs when the debug feature is enabled, which is disabled by default in WordPress.  For mitigation, users should update the LiteSpeed Cache plugin to version 6.5.0.1, which addresses this issue.  Additionally, old log files that may contain leaked cookie information should be deleted. Direct access to log files should also be prevented.

Malicious modifications to NAT may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.\nNetwork devices such as routers and firewalls that connect multiple networks together may implement NAT during the process of passing packets between networks. When performing NAT, the network device will rewrite the source and/or destination addresses of the IP address header. Some network designs require NAT for the packets to cross the border device.  A typical example of this is environments where internal networks make use of non-Internet routable addresses.\nWhen an adversary gains control of a network boundary device, they can either leverage existing NAT configurations to send traffic between two separated networks, or they can implement NAT configurations of their own design.  In the case of network designs that require NAT to function, this enables the adversary to overcome inherent routing limitations that would normally prevent them from accessing protected systems behind the border device.  In the case of network designs that do not require NAT, address translation can be used by adversaries to obscure their activities, as changing the addresses of packets that traverse a network boundary device can make monitoring data transmissions more challenging for defenders.  \nAdversaries may use \n to change the operating system of a network device, implementing their own custom NAT mechanisms to further obscure their activities\n https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599/001/", "2020", 1]

Okta, a leading technology company in Identity and Access Management (IAM), has fixed a critical vulnerability in Okta Verify for Windows. This vulnerability could allow attackers to steal user passwords. The vulnerability was discovered during the company's regular penetration testing.  The vulnerability affects Okta Verify Agent for Windows versions 5.0.2 through 5.3.2 and is identified as CVE-2024-9191. It is related to the Okta Device Access feature. This vulnerability allows attackers with access to a compromised device to retrieve passwords associated with users' passwordless logins via the OktaDeviceAccessPipe. However, the vulnerability only affects users utilizing the passwordless Okta Device Access feature. Users using Okta Verify on other platforms or only the FastPass feature are not affected. Okta has addressed this vulnerability in version 5.3.3 of the Verify Agent for Windows and recommends that affected customers update to the latest version as soon as possible to mitigate the risk. The vulnerability was initially discovered on April 17, 2024, in version 5.0.2, and Okta released an Early Access version with a fix on September 20, 2024, before the general release on October 25, 2024.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/11/06/%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%87%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a7%e0%b9%88%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%99-okta-verify-agent-windows-%e0%b8%97%e0%b8%b3%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%ab%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%9c%e0%b8%b9%e0%b9%89%e0%b9%82/", "2024", 0]

The recent\n‘Flamer’\nspyware virus that targeted PCs in a number of Middle Eastern countries shows the international nature of the threat, and highlights the fact that attackers are developing highly specialised malware. Our success in countering these constantly evolving risks depends on our ability to share knowledge across borders - with governments, the IT industry, the academic world and with IT users. Working with organisations such as ISACA provides  with a further opportunity to share good practice and support improved network and information security for all.”\nProfessor Helmbrecht will be participating as a panellist with Mr Marc Vael of ISACA and a representative from NIST – The US National Institute of Standards and Technology. The session is will cover changing threats, what is around the corner, corporate espionage, coming information sharing, cyber harassment’s impact on business related issues and moving from the physical to the cyber world. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisas-international-security-message", "2012", 0]

This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.\nOrdered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.\nSticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.\nIn addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Implementation\nIf the application only requires communication with its own components, then the destination is always known, and an explicit intent could be used.\n https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/927.html", "2013", 1]

Most links included in the phishing messages contain Bing redirect URLs. Other prominent domains include krxd[.]com (linked to Salesforce applications) and cf-ipfs[.]com (Cloudflare's Web3 service).  Using QR codes offers advantages over embedding phishing links directly in emails, most importantly the ability to bypass anti-phishing solutions, as the phishing link is hidden within the QR code image. Researchers observed a monthly growth percentage for this campaign exceeding 270%. The overall campaign has grown by more than 2,400% since May 2023. Researchers say this is the largest campaign ever using QR codes observed by Cofense, a situation suggesting that attackers are testing the effectiveness of QR codes.

Cybersecurity researchers recommend users immediately upgrade Adobe Acrobat Reader and Adobe Acrobat after the discovery of a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-41869) which could be exploited to execute remote code. This vulnerability was discovered through the EXPMON platform and a publicly released Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit.  By opening a specially crafted PDF file, attackers can leverage this vulnerability to access memory and execute malicious code.  The vulnerability is related to a \"Use-After-Free\" error, where the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unexpected behavior such as crashes or freezes.  If attackers manage to inject malicious code into that memory location, they can easily execute it on the target device. Although a security update was released in August, it reportedly did not fully address the issue. Users who updated to the new version still experienced application crashes when clicking or closing a specific dialog box. However, Adobe has since released the latest update that fixes this flaw.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 256/67 (IT) on Thursday, July 18, 2024, warned that malicious actors are actively exploiting a recently disclosed security flaw in Apache HugeGraph-Server, which could lead to remote code execution (RCE) attacks.  The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-27348 and assigned a CVSS score of 9.8, affects all versions of the software prior to 1.3.0.  The flaw resides in the Gremlin Graph Traversal API, allowing attackers to execute remote commands.  The Apache Software Foundation urges users to upgrade to version 1.3.0 with Java 11 and enable authentication.  Furthermore, enabling the 'Whitelist-IP/port' function enhances the security of RESTful-API operations.  Penetration testing firm SecureLayer7 published technical details about the flaw in early June, stating it allows attackers to bypass sandbox restrictions and execute code, granting full control of potentially affected servers.  This week, Shadowserver reported observing widespread exploitation attempts leveraging this vulnerability. Users are urged to update their software to the latest version as soon as possible.

If you cannot reach them or there is no answer, be suspicious that it is a scammer.\nDo not click on links from various communication channels such as SMS, LINE, Messenger, or others.\nDo not accept friend requests from unknown individuals on social media.\nDo not install apps from websites, links, or QR codes. If you want to install an app, open Google Play or the App Store to search for the app and install it yourself.\nDo not scan your face unless it is the bank's app.\n https://www.tba.or.th/5-%e0%b8%a7%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%98%e0%b8%b5%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%9a%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%b7%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%88%e0%b8%89%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%8a%e0%b8%b5%e0%b8%9e%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%81/", "2024", 0]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 295/67 (IT) reported on Monday, August 19, 2024, that the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) was cyber-attacked last Wednesday, along with several other banks in the country, causing disruption to Iran's financial system.  Iran International reports that the scale and impact of this attack may be one of the largest cyberattacks ever faced by Iran's infrastructure.  In addition, it was reported that hackers were also able to steal account holder information.  There were also notes placed on ATMs that read, \"Dear customers, you cannot withdraw money from the bank because all of Iran's national budget and resources have been invested in warfare for the benefit of the corrupt regime of the Islamic Republic.\"  This cyberattack comes at a time of heightened tension as Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, threatened to retaliate for the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.

This vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication, allowing malicious actors to access sensitive information.  This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to access the target system without requiring a username or password. Oracle explains in the advisory that \"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to download files accessible under the PLM application’s privileges from the target system.\" Such an attack could lead to the exfiltration of files containing sensitive information without the target system being aware of the intrusion.  Security researchers from CrowdStrike, Joel Snape and Lutz Wolf, discovered and reported the vulnerability.  Oracle has made efforts to address this issue promptly.  However, it is currently unclear what the target of such attacks is or how widespread they are.  Administrators are advised to check the software version they are using and immediately install patches or update the system as soon as possible. Doing so will reduce the risk of being attacked and protect important data in the system from malicious actors.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/11/22/oracle-%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%95%e0%b8%b7%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%87%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a7%e0%b9%88%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%99-agile-plm-framework-%e0%b8%96%e0%b8%b9%e0%b8%81%e0%b9%83/", "2024", 0]

Reveton, in particular, launched in 2011, is known as one of the first ransomware-as-a-service operations and reportedly earned the group as much as $400,000 per month.  Silnikau is also charged in connection with operating the Ransom Cartel ransomware, starting in May 2021, and using hidden websites to track and control ransomware attacks.

These files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (\n for Windows and \n for Linux and macOS).\nOn Linux and Mac, users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a \".\" as the first character in the file or folder name  \n \n. Files and folders that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like \"ls\". Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.\nFiles on macOS can also be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app \n. On Windows, users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known hosts and keys.\nAdversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.\n https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/001/", "2020", 1]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 326/67 (IT) Tuesday, September 17, 2024. Researchers from Aqua Security discovered new malware called \"Hadooken,\" which attacks WebLogic servers.  The malware's name comes from an attack move in the game Street Fighter.  Hadooken's capabilities include installing cryptocurrency mining software (cryptominer) and deploying Tsunami malware, which can be used for later system breaches.  This attack targets WebLogic servers, developed by Oracle and often used in large organizations. Attackers gain access to the servers through weak passwords. They then use shell scripts and Python to download and install the malware on the server, while also attempting to hide traces of the attack. Researchers found that the Hadooken malware was downloaded from two IP addresses: 89.185.85.102 (still active), registered in Germany, and 185.174.136.204 (no longer active), registered in Russia.  The still-active IP has been linked to the TeamTNT and Gang 8220 groups. However, researchers do not yet have enough evidence to confirm the source of this attack.  Searching for additional information through Shodan revealed more than 230,000 WebLogic servers connected to the internet. Although most are well-protected, some may be vulnerable to attack.  Researchers recommend that administrators monitor and update their software to prevent future attacks.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/09/17/hadooken-%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%a5%e0%b9%81%e0%b8%a7%e0%b8%a3%e0%b9%8c-linux-%e0%b8%95%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%a7%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a1%e0%b9%88-%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%b3%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%94/", "2024", 0]

A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability on Zimbra servers has recently been disclosed. This vulnerability, CVE-2024-45519, allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands and immediately take control of vulnerable systems. Zimbra has released an update to address this issue but has not yet disclosed in-depth details about the flaw.\n\nResearchers from Proofpoint have observed attacks targeting this vulnerability since September 28th. Attackers sent spoofed emails from Gmail with base64-encoded malicious code via the CC field to execute shell commands on vulnerable servers. This allowed attackers to install web shells, enabling remote access and control of the server. Researchers from HarfangLab indicated that the source of these malicious emails originated from a server in Bulgaria and urged administrators to apply the patch as soon as possible to prevent attacks.  Proofpoint reports that the volume of attacks has not decreased since they began and appears to be opportunistic, not specifically targeting any particular organization.\n\nResearchers also warn that patching this vulnerability is critical, as Zimbra is widely used in both corporate and government sectors worldwide, making it a prime target for attackers seeking to steal sensitive data.  https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/10/03/%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%87%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a7%e0%b9%88-zimbra-rce-%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%aa%e0%b8%b5%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%87%e0%b8%96%e0%b8%b9%e0%b8%81%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%88%e0%b8%a1/", "2024", 0]

Website security company Sucuri warns that more than 39,000 websites are infected with a new family of malware that redirects website visitors to fraudulent domains and unwanted advertisements. The name Sign1 comes from the discovery of JavaScript malware in WordPress custom HTML widgets or within the Simple Custom CSS and JS WordPress plugin that attackers added to compromised websites. Using this method, hackers spread malware to websites without placing malicious code in server files, allowing the malware to go unnoticed for long periods, as it is common for security providers to scan website files for malware rather than checking databases.

The attack utilizes sophisticated malware to achieve cyber espionage objectives.

The BangkokShell attack process begins with DLL Side-loading to load obfuscated shellcode into the process memory before deobfuscating it. It then uses Reflective Code Loading to load and execute the payload, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), without leaving any traces on the filesystem.  TTC-CERT refers to this payload as RahadRAT.

As a community we need to move beyond  \"shift-left\" in the coding space to pre-code activities that are critical for the principles of Secure by Design. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) include  CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information ,  CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials ,  CWE-501: Trust Boundary Violation , and  CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials .\nInsecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses, expressed as “missing or ineffective control design.” Insecure design is not the source for all other Top 10 risk categories. There is a difference between insecure design and insecure implementation. We differentiate between design flaws and implementation defects for a reason, they have different root causes and remediation. A secure design can still have implementation defects leading to vulnerabilities that may be exploited. An insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against specific attacks. One of the factors that contribute to insecure design is the lack of business risk profiling inherent in the software or system being developed, and thus the failure to determine what level of security design is required. https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/", "2021", 1]

Usability Considerations<br>Subsection: 10.2.5 Multi-Factor OTP Device </br><br># Content: ***Typical Usage***\n\nUsers access the OTP generated by the multi-factor OTP device through a second authentication factor. The OTP is typically displayed on the device and the user manually enters it for the verifier. The second authentication factor may be achieved through some kind of integral entry pad to enter a memorized secret, an integral biometric (e.g., fingerprint) reader, or a direct computer interface (e.g., USB port). Usability considerations for the additional factor apply as well — see [Section 10.2.1](#page63) for memorized secrets and [Section 10.4](#page69) for biometrics used in multi-factor authenticators.\n\nUsability considerations for typical usage include:\n\n* User experience during manual entry of the authenticator output.\n\n1. For time-based OTP, provide a grace period in addition to the time during which the OTP is displayed. Users need adequate time to enter the authenticator output,\n\nincluding looking back and forth between the multi-factor OTP device and the entry screen.\n\n1. Consider form-factor constraints if users must unlock the multi-factor OTP device via an integral entry pad or enter the authenticator output on mobile devices. Typing on small devices is significantly more error prone and time-consuming than typing on a traditional keyboard. The smaller the integral entry pad and onscreen keyboard, the more difficult it is to type. Providing larger touch areas\n\nimproves usability for unlocking the multi-factor OTP device or entering the authenticator output on mobile devices.\n\n1. Limited availability of a direct computer interface like a USB port could pose usability difficulties. For example, laptop computers often have a limited number of USB ports, which may force users to unplug other USB peripherals to use the multi-factor OTP device. </br><br># Source: nist 800-63b-3<br># URL: <a href='https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63b.pdf'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

This has a profound impact on all aspects of citizens’ everyday life, as e-services are all now totally dependent on an open, safe and secure cyberspace. These are the technologies that are being built today and that will deliver the services of the future.\nIt is therefore essential for citizens to participate actively in improving information security, for  to facilitate improvement processes and for Member States to ensure that security policy supports the internet based economy envisaged for Europe 2020.

Alder Hey Children's Hospital in the UK has revealed that its systems were attacked, with patient data and other sensitive information stolen and published online.  The ransomware group Inc Ransom claimed to have obtained data between 2018 and 2024. The hospital confirmed it is increasing security measures and that the incident has not affected current services. Meanwhile, Wirral University Teaching Hospital had to shut down its IT systems and revert to paper records after suspicious activity was detected. The incident caused some services, such as appointments and surgeries, to be postponed. While emergency services remain available, patients may experience longer wait times in the emergency department.  Although there is no confirmation that the Wirral incident is ransomware-related, system shutdowns are a common response to such events.

This was a 2-day meeting of 40 experts from national authorities supervising the telecom sector across Europe.\n\nThe meeting was opened by Mr. Vladica Tintor, Director of RATEL, who gave an overview of the structure and activities of RATEL. Jovan Milosavljevic gave a great talk on the work of the National Centre for the Prevention of Security Risks in ICT systems, i.e. the national CSIRT, how they work, how breach reporting is set up and what the current priorities are, etc. The national CSIRT is a part of RATEL.\nThe meeting proceeded with liaison statements from related groups like the NIS Cooperation Group, and the NIS CG work streams on digital services and digital infrastructure.  presented its paper on Security Supervision under the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC), which is due to be published in December. The EECC expands the telecom security provisions in Article 13a of the Framework directive and will cover also so-called Over-the-top providers of communications services.\nAt the end of the day  opened discussions about a number of challenges, which will have to be addressed by the group going forward under the new legislative framework, such as the new definition of security in the EECC, the new reporting parameters in the EECC and the new  tool for EECC breach reporting CIRAS (Cyber Incident Reporting and Analysis System). As a social event offered by RATEL the group paid a visit to the Nikola Tesla museum in Belgrade. Tesla was the first to envisage and develop wireless/radio communication technology and he foresaw that indeed such communication technology would drastically change the world.\nOn the second day, each country gave an update on their state of play and relevant recent incidents.  presented a plan and timeline for updating the Article 13a security framework, which needs adaptation for the EECC. BEREC presented the results of its survey on 5G auctions. BAKOM, the telecom regulator of Switzerland, gave an overview of its work on power outages and their impact on telecom networks.\nThe Article 13a group will change name and, where needed, membership, to adapt to the new legislation, the EECC. In 2020, much of the work of the group will be dedicated to updating the guidelines for security measures and to adapt the incident reporting process to the new provisions.\nIf you like to know more about this work, or if you want to join our telecom security mailing lists to be kept up to date about our telecom security work or to receive invitations for future telecom security meetings, please contact us via\nresilience@.europa.eu\nBackground\nThis work is done under 's Annual work program output O.1.2.3 “Supporting incident reporting activities in the EU”\nThe  Article 13a expert group was set up in 2010.

The event, which took place from 2\nnd\nto 4\nth\nFebruary, attracted over 2000 participants from the EU and from around the world.\nThe conference addressed standardisation in relation to the\nRadio Equipment Directive\n(RED) and certification under the provisions of the\nCybersecurity Act\n(CSA).\nObjectives of the conference\nThe purpose of the conference was twofold. The event presented the current developments in the areas. It was also intended to foster a dialogue among policymakers, industry, research, standardisation and certification organisations, including all of those involved in the development of the ICT certification framework in Europe. The ultimate objective of the exercise is to implement the Cybersecurity Act in the most effective way.\nThe objectives of the presentations and key topics addressed by the conference panels were the following:\nCybersecurity requirements and standardisation activities under the scope of the\nRadio Equipment Directive\n:\nThe presentation focussed on the cybersecurity requirements of the Directive. The European Commission is preparing delegated acts as well as a request for standardisation to CEN-CENELEC and ETSI. The panel highlighted the connection between the European regulatory requirements and explored how standardisation can align with the EU policy goals in a global context. The participants were invited to discuss the link between the requirements of the RED and those associated with the Cybersecurity Act.\nStandardisation supporting the\nCybersecurity Act\nThis part of the conference introduced the current state of play in cybersecurity standardisation. The purpose of the discussion was also to draw attention to the gaps identified that need to the bridged. Each panellist was given the floor to present updates from their organisations.\nDevelopments on standardisation in the area of Consumer IoT:\nThe panel addressed the situation of standardisation in this area in relation to the general security standard active since last year.\nThe attention was drawn on sectorial standards and whether standards for smart homes, the automotive or house appliance for instance would be relevant ones to address. Interesting questions came up to liven the debate on the subsequent steps of certification, on how certification will impact end user behaviour or how to promote certified products.\nStandardisation of 5G, next steps foreseen:\nThe panel engaged in a discussion on the progress made so far on the standardisation of 5G. As preparations for a cybersecurity certification scheme for 5G networks are now beginning, important aspects needed to be addressed. It was important to stress the potential of certification given the number of initiatives already launched in the area and identify prospects for the future.\nCybersecurity Certification\nSecuring EU’s Vision on 5G: Cybersecurity Certification\nThe last panel closed the conference on a discussion focussed on the future of cybersecurity certification in general. It comes as the European Commission requested  to prepare a candidate cybersecurity certification scheme on 5G networks on 3\nrd\nFebruary 2021.\nHow should the standardisation activities be prepared? How should these activities match with and help achieve the goals of the Union rolling work programme? Such questions remain to be answered in a comprehensive way.\nAs evidenced by the high number of participants such questions obviously stimulate the interest of a very large audience showing how crucial it is to open the debate as widely as possible to respond to these challenges adequately. Therefore, the audience of the conference and the public at large are most likely to expect a follow-up edition to take place in early 2022.\nBackground\nArticle 8 of the\nCybersecurity Act\ngives mandate to the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity to monitor developments in the area of standardisation. The work of the Agency builds on the on-going standardisation work of the European Standardisation Organisations: CEN, CENELEC, ETSI, as well as the Cybersecurity Coordination Group (CSCG).  engages its expertise to support these organisations, the European Commission and all other relevant stakeholders. In addition,  is also cooperating with the Standard Developing Organisations (SDOs), namely ISO SC27 (Liaison), ETSI (Memorandum of Understanding) and CEN CENELEC (Collaboration agreement).\nFurther Information\nThe slides presented during the conference will be made available within the next few weeks on the website of the\nCybersecurity Standardisation Conference\n website – Standards Topic\nEuropean Committee for Standardization\n(CEN)\nEuropean Committee for Electronical Standardization\n(CENELEC)\nETSI\nRadio Equipment Directive\n(RED)\nCybersecurity Act\n(CSA)\nEU Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade\nSecuring EU’s Vision on 5G: Cybersecurity Certification\nContacts\nFor questions related to the press and interviews, please contact\npress (at) .europa.eu, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/highlights-of-the-cybersecurity-standardisation-conference'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Selecting Assurance Level<br>Subsection: 6.1 Selecting IAL </br><br># Content: The IAL decision tree in Figure 6-1 combines the results from the risk assessment with additional considerations related to identity proofing services to allow agencies to select the most appropriate identity proofing requirements for their digital service offering. The IAL selection does not mean the digital service provider will need to perform the proofing themselves. More information on whether an agency can federate is provided in Section 7.\n\n# Step 1 : To provide the service, do you need any personal information? \n- The risk assessment and IAL selection can be short circuited by answering this question first. If the service does not require any personal information to execute any digital transactions, the system can operate at IAL1.\n\n# Step 2 : To complete the transaction, do you need the information to be validated?\n- If personal information is needed, the RP needs to determine if validated and verified attributes are required, or if self-asserted attributes are acceptable. If even a single validated and verified attribute is needed, then the provider will need to accept attributes that have been IAL2 or IAL3 proofed. Again, the selection of IAL can be short circuited to IAL1 if the agency can deliver the digital service with self-asserted attributes only.\n\n# Step 3 : What are the risks (to the organization or the subject) of providing the digital service?\n- At this point, the agency understands that some level of proofing is required. Step 3 isintended to look at the potential impacts of an identity proofing failure to determine if IAL2 orIAL3 is the most appropriate selection. The primary identity proofing failure an agency mayencounter is accepting a falsified identity as true, therefore providing a service or benefit to thewrong or ineligible person. In addition, proofing, when not required, or collecting moreinformation than needed is a risk in and of itself. Hence, obtaining verified attributeinformation when not needed is also considered an identity proofing failure. This step shouldidentify if the agency answered Step 1 and 2 incorrectly, realizing they do not need personalinformation to deliver the service. Risk should be considered from the perspective of theorganization and to the user, since one may not be negatively impacted while the other couldbe significantly harmed. Agency risk management processes should commence with this step.\n\n# Step 4 : Do you need resolve an identity uniquely?\n- is intended to determine if the personal information required by the agency willultimately resolve to a unique identity. In other words, the agency needs to know the fullidentity of the subject accessing the digital service, and pseudonymous access, even with a fewvalidated and verified attributes, is not possible. If the agency needs to uniquely identify thesubject, the process can end. However, the agency should consider if Step 5 is of value tothem, as the acceptance of claims will reduce exposure to the risk of over collecting andstoring more personal information than is necessary.\n\n# Step 5 : Can you accept references? \n- focuses on whether the digital service can be provided without having access to fullattribute values. This does not mean all attributes must be delivered as claims, but this stepdoes ask the agency to look at each personal attribute they have deemed necessary, andidentify which can suffice as claims and which need to be complete values. A federatedenvironment is best suited for receiving claims, as the digital service provider is not in controlof the attribute information to start with. If the application also performs all required identityproofing, claims may not make sense since full values are already under the digital serviceprovider's control.\n\n# Step 6 : Use references if you can complete the transaction or offer the service without complete arttibute values?\n- If the agency has reached Step 6, claims should be used. This step identifies the digital serviceas an excellent candidate for accepting federated attribute references from a CSP (or multipleCSPs), since it has been determined that complete attribute values are not needed to deliver thedigital service.\n </br><br># Source: nist 800-63-3<br># URL: <a href='https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-3.pdf'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Eleven EU countries reported 51 severe outages of electronic communication networks or services. Today,  publishes the first ever annual report on this, containing an analysis of incidents in 2011.\n\nUnder Article 13a of the EU’s telecom reform directive (\nDirective 2009/140/EC\n), EU Member States are required to make summary reports on major outages once a year to  and the European Commission. The first summary incident reports for 2011 were sent to  in May 2012. In total, 11 countries reported outages. This number reflects the fact that many countries implemented national reporting schemes only towards the end of 2011.  Experts Marnix Dekker and Christoffer Karsberg remark:\n“\nThis year,\nthe Member States have more mature national incident reporting schemes. So next year we expect to publish an annual report with about 10 times more incidents.”\nIn the annual report,  summarizes and analyses the 51 reported incidents:\nMost of the reported incidents affected mobile telephony or mobile internet (60%).\nIncidents affecting mobile telephony or mobile internet affected most users (around 300.000 users), which is consistent with the high number of mobile users.\nIncidents show that communication services (both fixed and mobile) strongly depend on the power supply.\nNatural phenomena like storms, floods and heavy snow have a big impact on the power supply of providers. Natural phenomena cause long lasting incidents, around 45 hours on average.\nThe annual report also provides a summary of Article 13a and how it was implemented by  and the EU Member States. The incidents will be discussed in more detail in the\nArticle 13a working  group\nwhich consists of all electronic communication regulators from EU countries, and technical experts from . In 2013,  and the EC will collect the incident reports concerning outages that occurred in 2012. The next annual report will be published in the spring of 2013.\nThe Executive Director of ,\nProfessor Udo Helmbrecht\ncomments:\n“We are now, for the first time, equipped with an overview of major cyber incidents in Europe. This is a decisive moment for the EU’s efforts to improve understanding of the impact of cyber security incidents. But this still deals with only a small subset of cyber security incidents.

This is particularly the case with federation scenarios (described in [SP800-63C]) in which the authentication event necessarily involves the coordination of several components and parties across a network.To facilitate this behavior, a session MAY be started in response to an authentication event and continue until it is terminated. The session MAY be terminated for any number of reasons, including but not limited to an inactivity timeout or an explicit logout event. The session MAY be extended through a reauthentication event (described in Sec. 5.2) in which the subscriber repeats some of the initial authentication process or performs a full authentication, thereby reestablishing the authenticated session.Session management is preferable to the continual presentation of credentials, as the poor usability of continual presentation often creates incentives for workarounds (e.g., caching activation factors), thereby negating authentication intent and obscuring the freshness of the authentication event. </br><br># Source: nist 800-63b-4<br># URL: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

I don’t think it is a coincidence that our overall Presidency motto ‘Protect, Strengthen, and Prepare’, is so central to cybersecurity in general. In a world where technology is evolving at a rapid pace, where cyber threats are multiplying and becoming more complex, it is imperative that we adapt our cybersecurity approach to address unprecedented challenges. A flexible, adaptable, and proactive approach to cybersecurity is the guarantee to create vital trust in the ongoing digital transformation, and to make sure that new technologies are secure.”\nEU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director,\nJuhan Lepassaar,\nstated that “Implementing the cybersecurity legal framework of the last two years and ensuring the operational capabilities to deal with emerging cyber challenges will be our measure of success. These ongoing discussions will enable the Agency to propose recommendations in the first ever State of Cybersecurity in the Union report that will direct Europe's strategic mission for a high common level of cybersecurity.”\nThis year significant attention was dedicated to the ongoing implementation process of the latest EU cybersecurity policies, both from the national and EU perspective. Against the backdrop of evolving geopolitical developments and the ever-shifting cyber threat landscape, discussions also touched upon the complexities and hurdles within the cybersecurity world and how they will eventually shape the policy priorities of tomorrow.\nThe first panel covered the deployment of Active Cyber Protection (ACP) measures by Member States within the existing EU legislation and policy framework and the means to boost it by building smart regulatory mechanisms and collaborative implementation.\nThe second round of discussions addressed market and product challenges, and particularly the digital product and services certification requirements that have attracted the attention of the cybersecurity community.\nThe topic of certification was also approached in the light of the skills gap that we are facing and its link with building cyber resilience in the EU. On the occasion of the Cybersecurity Certification week and the current progress on the matter, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity is also holding today the Annual Cybersecurity Certification Conference on in Brussels.\nAmong the themes of the conference was the implementation process of the NIS2 Directive provisions and its impact on critical infrastructure sectors, the necessity for more synergies between defence and civilian cybersecurity communities, as well as the emergence of global cybersecurity threats, combined with the rise of new technologies, such as AI, and how policy foresight in this domain might contribute towards better cybersecurity preparedness.\nIn 2023,  developed the NIS 360 methodology to do an assessment of NIS sectors on an annual basis, to understand better their overall maturity, criticality and to identify areas for improvement. The first edition covered 10 NIS sub-sectors. The policy framework in the finance sector is the most mature, while the telecoms, digital infrastructure, trust and finance sectors are scoring the highest in risk management.\nThe conference ended with a special session to celebrate the 20\nth\nanniversary of , moderated by Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar with Pierre Cartuyvels, Deputy Permanent Representative of Belgium to the European Union, Katalin Molnár.

Privacy Considerations<br>Subsection: 7.6 Agency-Specific Privacy Compliance </br><br># Content: The guidelines cover specific compliance obligations for federal CSPs. It is critical to involve an agency’s SAOP in the earliest stages of identity service development to assess and mitigate privacy risks and advise the agency on compliance requirements, such as whether or not the PII collection to conduct identity proofing triggers the Privacy Act of 1974 [PrivacyAct] or the E-Government Act of 2002 [E-Gov] requirement to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment. For example, with respect to identity proofing, it is likely that the Privacy Act requirements will be triggered and require coverage by either a new or existing Privacy Act system of records notice (SORN) due to the collection and maintenance of PII or other attributes necessary to conduct identity proofing.<br>The SAOP can similarly assist the agency in determining whether a PIA is required. These considerations should not be read as a requirement to develop a Privacy Act SORN or PIA for identity proofing alone; in many cases it will make the most sense to draft a PIA and SORN that encompasses the entire digital identity lifecycle or includes the identity proofing process as part of a larger, programmatic PIA that discusses the program or benefit to which the agency is establishing online access.<br>Due to the many components of the digital identity lifecycle, it is important for the SAOP to have an awareness and understanding of each individual component. For example, other privacy artifacts may be applicable to an agency offering or using proofing services such as Data Use Agreements, Computer Matching Agreements, etc. The SAOP can assist the agency in determining what additional requirements apply. Moreover, a thorough understanding of the individual components of digital authentication will enable the SAOP to thoroughly assess and mitigate privacy risks either through compliance processes or by other means. </br><br># Source: nist 800-63a-4<br># URL: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

During routine open-source intelligence (OSINT) research on the internet, the TTC-CERT discovered the website hxxps://sites.google.com/view/documentfb being used to distribute files containing Infostealer malware.  The website is written in Thai and entices users to download files from links within the site. The TTC-CERT believes the attackers created this website specifically to target Thai users.\n\nThe Infostealer malware used in this attack is capable of stealing data from web browsers, such as passwords, cookies, and browsing history. It can also steal sessions from various applications, including Discord, Telegram, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, and Tiktok.  Furthermore, the malware can steal information related to the victim's crypto wallet and collect basic information about the target computer, such as computer name, operating system version, and RAM size.  This data is then exfiltrated via Discord Webhook and the attacker's Command and Control (C2) server.

The report is the result of an Emerging and Future Risk assessment based on scenario building and analysis. E-health is the first scenario that has been developed and analyzed by an international group of interdisciplinary experts. In the report 14 risks have been identified. It also underlines the importance of a cautionary approach to be followed in regards to the adoption of beneficial e-health solutions: “Caution seems to be the prudent answer at this point: the benefits are clear, but also the risks entailed cannot be ignored”.\nIn our scenario Ralph is a diabetic, enrolled in a remote health monitoring and treatment programme. He goes about his daily business wearing a special vest with biosensors, keeping track of his vital signs, ensuring rapid response from doctors, while his personal data may be literally flowing around, in order to enable this kind of service. This scenario shows us that remote health schemes undoubtedly offer a great potential. Many benefits can be identified for citizens’ wellbeing and quality of life, but what are the risks entailed? It seems that e-health solutions are very important and beneficial. At the same time, they may generate serious considerations, regarding security, privacy, data protection and legal, as well as in the social, political and ethical area\nIn the course of the study, the major assets that are to be protected, e.g. health, life, human rights, etc, have been identified. Based on this, the most important risks generated regarding these assets are subsequently identified and further analysed. This is following a comprehensive risk assessment approach, as developed by  in the context of the Emerging and Future Risks Framework. In a nutshell, the report draws the attention to 14 major risks in total, among them breaches of data protection legislation, mission creep meaning secondary use of data, intrusive data surveillance and profiling by insurance companies, employers, credit-checking companies, etc, data loss or theft, system failures and service disruption.\nThe Agency commented:\n“With the development of the EFR capacity, the agency aims at early identification of risks for new application areas and/or technologies. This will help developers and policy makers understand the impacts of new application and manage the resulting risks. At the example of the analyzed e-Health scenario  underlines the risks of an overly optimistic approach to e-health, driven by the industry. While such initiatives and services are undoubtedly beneficial and worth deploying for the general good, we must at least identify and understand the various challenges posed and need to be overcome, in particular in respect to security and privacy.”\nFull report\nAnnex I: Scenario building and analysis template\nAnnex II: Risk analysis report\nFAQ, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/remote-health-monitoring-scenario'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

When an authenticator is added, the CSP SHOULD send a notification to the subscriber via a mechanism that is independent of the transaction binding the new authenticator (e.g., email to an address previously associated with the subscriber). The CSP MAY limit the number of authenticators that may be bound in this manner. </br><br># Source: nist 800-63b-3<br># URL: <a href='https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63b.pdf'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Attribute Synchronization </br><br># Content: In a federated process, the IdP and RP each have their own stores of identity attributes associated with the subscriber account. The IdP has a direct view of the subscriber account’s attributes, but the RP subscriber account is derived from a subset of those attributes that are presented during the federation transaction. Therefore, it is possible for the IdP’s and RP’s attribute stores to diverge from each other over time.From the RP’s perspective, the IdP is the trusted source for any attributes that the IdP asserts as being associated with the subscriber account at the IdP. The provenance of the IdP’s attributes, and their validation process, is stipulated in the trust agreement.However, the RP MAY additionally collect, and optionally verify, other attributes to associate with the RP subscriber account, as discussed in Sec. 4.6.6. Sometimes, these attributes can even override what is asserted by the IdP. For example, if an IdP asserts a full display name for the subscriber, the RP can allow the subscriber to provide an alternative preferred name for use at the RP.The IdP SHOULD signal downstream RPs when the attributes of a subscriber account available to the RP have been updated, and the RP MAY respond to this signal by updating the attributes in the RP subscriber account. This synchronization can be accomplished using shared signaling as described in Sec. 4.8, through a provisioning API as described in Sec. 4.6.5, or by providing a signal in the assertion (e.g., a timestamp indicating when relevant attributes were last updated) allowing the RP to determine that its cache is out of date. If the RP is granted access to an identity API as in Sec. 3.11.3, the IdP SHOULD allow the RP access to the API for sufficient time to perform synchronization operations after the federation transaction has concluded. For example, if the assertion is valid for five minutes, access to the identity API could be valid for 30 minutes to allow the RP to fetch and update attributes out of band.The IdP SHOULD signal downstream RPs when a subscriber account is terminated, or when the subscriber account’s access to an RP is revoked. This can be accomplished using shared signaling as described in Sec. 4.8 or through a provisioning API as described in Sec. 4.6.5. Upon receiving such a signal, the RP SHALL process the RP subscriber account as stipulated in the trust agreement. If the RP subscriber account is terminated, the RP SHALL remove all personal information associated with the RP subscriber account, in accordance with Sec. 3.10.3. If the reason for termination is suspicious or fraudulent activity, the IdP SHALL include this reason in its signal to the RP to allow the RP to review the account’s activity at the RP for suspicious activity, if specified in the trust agreement with that RP. </br><br># Source: nist 800-63c-4<br># URL: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

The European initiative aims to highlight the benefits of rail as a sustainable, smart and safe means of transport to support the delivery of its European Green Deal objectives in the transport field.\nCybersecurity is a key requirement to enable railways to deploy and take advantage of the full extent of a connected, digital environment.\nHowever, European infrastructure managers and railway undertakings face a complex regulatory system that requires a deep understanding of operational cybersecurity actions. In addition, European rail is undergoing a major transformation of its operations, systems and infrastructure due to digitalisation, mass transit and, increasing interconnections. Therefore, the implementation of cybersecurity requirements is fundamental for the digital enhancement and security of the sector.\n,\nthe EU Agency for Cybersecurity\n, and ERA,\nthe EU Agency for Railways\n, have joined forces to organise a virtual\nConference on Rail Cybersecurity\n. The conference took place virtually over two days and brought together more than 600 experts from railway organisations, policy, industry, research, standardisation and certification.\nPolicy\nThe European Commission has proposed the revision of the Network Information Security Directive (NIS2) to strengthen the cybersecurity measures to be adopted by the Member States and applied, among others, by European railway undertakings (RU) and infrastructure managers (IM).\nThe European Commission’s Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE) also encourages awareness-raising of railway stakeholders by promoting the use of its Land Transport Security platform. A cybersecurity toolkit was also developed and shared with the participants. Cybersecurity is now a major concern for National Safety Authorities. The French rail safety authority,\nl’établissement public de sécurité ferroviaire\n(the EPSF) compiled the related challenges in a white paper, jointly with the French IM and main RU, the French Cybersecurity Agency, ANSSI and ERA.\nStandardisation & Certification\nThe Working Group 26 of\nthe European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation\n(CENELEC) delivered the promising Technical Specification 50701 on cybersecurity for railways, now under review by the National Committees. A published version of the technical specification is expected before the summer. A voluntary reference to this standard will be made through the application guides developed by ERA. Railway stakeholders expect the technical specification to lay the foundations of a common risk analysis methodology. As demonstrated by the case study proposed by the Italian railway stakeholders, such methodology will link the security analysis to the safety case.\nResearch & Innovation\nShift2Rail\nthe Joint Undertaking has gained maturity, and the\nTechnical Demonstrator 2.11\non cybersecurity will soon demonstrate the applicability of their findings on specific projects such as Automatic Train Operation or Adaptable Communication Systems.\nTechnical interoperability standards for EU railway automation are being proposed for consideration in the railway regulatory framework, proposing \"secure by design\" shared railway services. In addition,\nThe International Union of Railways\n(UIC), recently launched a Cyber Security Solution Platform, taking a pragmatic approach in building a solutions catalogue to risks and vulnerabilities identified by railway users.\nInformation Sharing & Cooperation\nThe European Railway-ISAC is attracting an increasing number of participants willing to share concerns or even vulnerabilities to trusted members and ensuring a collective response to the cybersecurity challenge. An open call by Shift2Rail, namely the\n4SECURERAIL\nproject, is developing a proposal for a European Computer Security Incident Response Team, allowing for identified threats to be instantly shared with targeted railway stakeholders.\nWith such developments, the railway industry, represented by\nthe European Rail Industry Association\n(UNIFE), discussed how ready the sector is to increase the level of cybersecurity. UNIFE highlighted several priorities, such as: the approval and usage of the TS 50701, the need for adequate certification schemes on product level,the need for specific protection profiles on interface-specific devices and subsystems. This would allow for a more harmonized approach for manufacturers and system integrators.\nConclusions\nThe participants voted topics for future conferences and these include, among others:\nnew technologies;\ncyber risk management for railways;\ncyber threat landscape;\nthe update of Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI);\ncyber skills and training and cyber incident response.\nBoth agencies are paying very close attention to all the developments in the field of railway cybersecurity.\nThe success of the online conference of the last two days shows how railway stakeholders can benefit from close cooperation to ensure that both the cybersecurity and the railway regulatory framework are cross-fertilised.\nBackground\nThe EU Agency for Cybersecurity plays a major role in the implementation of the NIS Directive by supporting Member States and the private sector in achieving a higher level of cybersecurity through the  annual work programme. The Agency has collaborated closely with railway undertakings and infrastructure managers over the years. It has engaged in the work on the implementation of the NIS Directive, and with ERA on cybersecurity for the European Rail Traffic Management System.\nThe Agency also supports the European Railway Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ER-ISAC) and offers expertise in the\nCEN CENELEC\ntechnical committee on Technical Specifications for Rail.\nThe Agency teamed up with ERA last year on a webinar to present the Agencies’ joint activities and to stress the importance of cybersecurity to railway stakeholders.\n also released a report on\nCybersecurity in Railways\nassessing the implementation in Member States of the Networks and Information Security Directive (NIS Directive), the first EU-wide cybersecurity legislation working to enhance cybersecurity across the Union. The  publication points to the numerous challenges experienced by operators of essential services when enforcing the NIS Directive, including:\nan overall lack of cybersecurity awareness in the sector and challenges of operational technology;\na strong dependency on the supply chain;\nthe presence of legacy systems;\ncomplexities due to the high number of systems to be secured and managed;\nconflicts between safety and security mind-sets.\nThe report also emphasises the need to find the right balance between cybersecurity, competitiveness and operational efficiency.\nFurther information\nThe slides presented during the conference are available on the webpage of the\n ERA conference\n.\nIf you missed the conference, the video is available on\n’s YouTube page\n.\nPrevious events:\nFree webinar: Cybersecurity in Railways\nand\n1st Transport Cyber Security Conference\n.\nContacts\nFor questions related to the press and interviews, please contact:\npress(at).europa.eu\nFor further questions related to the conferece, contact:\n-ERA-Conference(at).europa.eu, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cybersecurity-in-railways-conference-key-takeaways'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Security is crucial for gaining the trust of the EU citizens on using these services. However, there are many security challenges to overcome in order to ensure their successful deployment.\nThe TSP study underlines that:\nA mutual assistance system between supervisory bodies in the Member States should be set up.\nClient applications need to guarantee end-to-end encrypted communication with TSPs and e-Government services in order to safeguard EU citizens’ privacy.\nThe e-Government\ndocument\nuses a few of the European Commission-funded Large Scale Pilots that integrate TSP (\nepSOS\nfor health,\ne-CODEX\nfor justice and\nPEPPOL\nfor procurement) as case studies. These cases are used to analyse current practices and identify gaps and where improvements can be made. In this report, the Agency issues detailed technical security practices recommendations for TSP and e-Government Services using them, including time-stamping, e-delivery, long time preservation and e-signature validation.\nThe more general\nTSP report\nfrom  describes these services and the recommendations to improve their security in more detail.\nKey recommendations\nidentified to offer trustworthy e-Government services to EU citizens include:\nPromote\nTrusted Marks\nassessed against eIDAS requirements that would be recognised across borders.\nTrust Services should be developed in a European scope, complying with both EU and local legislation.\nSpecific Business Continuity Management standards should be adopted in the provision of trusted services (by TSPs) and required by e-Government customers.\nBased on the criticality of the e-government services, they should always assess three aspects:\nthe strength of the authentication mechanisms to be used, encouraging the use of e-Signature.\nthe need for end-to-end\nencryption\nand\nthe need for audit trails to keep electronic evidence\nThe guidelines for Trust Service Providers give recommendations in the areas of legal and regulatory framework of TSPs, risk assessment for TSPs and mitigation of security incidents. The main points highlighted by the reports include:\nlegal acts in the EU and at the national level\navailable standards applicable to trust services\nprocesses for effective risk management at TSPs\nhandling of security incidents occurring at TSPs, such as impersonation, compromise of Certificate Authority, organisational failures, etc.\nThe\nExecutive Director\nof , Professor Udo Helmbrecht, stated: “\nIt is vital for business and governments across Europe that citizens trust their online services and therefore implement the best technical e-signature solutions. These best practices need to be constantly reviewed through frequent risk analysis in order to keep up with the technical developments and overcome evolving cyber security challenges.”\nFor the\nfull reports\nBackground:\nThe proposed\nnew Regulation on electronic identification and trust\nservices for electronic transactions should supersede the current Directive 1999/93/EC.\nFor interviews;\nUlf Bergström, Spokesman,\nulf.bergstrom@.europa.eu\n, mobile: + 30 6948 460 143, or Dr. Manel Medina or Slawomir Gorniak, Experts,\nsta@.europa.eu, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/trustworthy-electronic-signatures-secure-e-government-and-trust-the-way-forward-for-improving-eu-citizens2019-trust-in-web-services-outlined-by-eu-agency-enisa'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

The RP in both OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 is known as the client.\n\nIn a successful OpenID Connect transaction, the IdP issues an ID Token, which is a signed assertion in JSON Web Token (JWT) format. The client parses the ID Token to learn about the subscriber and primary authentication event at the IdP. This token contains at minimum the following information about the subscriber and authentication event:\n\n* iss - An HTTPS URL identifying the IdP that issued the assertion.\n* sub - An IdP-specific subject identifier representing the subscriber.\n* aud - An IdP-specific audience identifier, equal to the OAuth 2.0 client identifier of the client at the IdP.\n* exp - The timestamp at which the ID Token expires and after which SHALL NOT be accepted the client.\n* iat - The timestamp at which the ID Token was issued and before which SHALL NOT be accepted by the client.\n\nIn addition to the ID Token, the IdP also issues the client an OAuth 2.0 access token which can be used to access the UserInfo Endpoint at the IdP. This endpoint returns a JSON object representing a set of attributes about the subscriber, including but not limited to their name, email address, physical address, phone number, and other profile information. While the information inside the ID Token is reflective of the authentication event, the information in the UserInfo Endpoint is generally more stable and could be more general purpose. Access to different attributes from the UserInfo Endpoint is governed by the use of a specially-defined set of OAuth scopes, openid, profile, email, phone, and address. An additional scope, offline\\_access, is used to govern the issuance of refresh tokens, which allow the RP to access the UserInfo Endpoint when the subscriber is not present. Access to the UserInfo Endpoint is structured as an API and may be available when the subscriber is not present. Therefore, access to the UserInfo Endpoint is not sufficient for proving a subscriber’s presence and establishing an authenticated session at the RP. </br><br># Source: nist 800-63c-3<br># URL: <a href='https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63c.pdf'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

The availability of such data makes it vulnerable to uses that may not be anticipated or desired by the subscriber and may inhibit subscriber adoption of federated services.\n\n[Section 5.2](#page22) requires CSPs to use measures to maintain the objectives of predictability (enabling reliable assumptions by individuals, owners, and operators about PII and its processing by an information system) and manageability (providing the capability for granular administration of PII, including alteration, deletion, and selective disclosure) commensurate with privacy risks that can arise from the processing of attributes for purposes other than identity proofing, authentication, authorization, or attribute assertion, related fraud mitigation, or to comply with law or legal process [[NISTIR8062](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8062)].\n\nCSPs may have various business purposes for processing attributes, including providing non-identity services to subscribers. However, processing attributes for purposes other than the identity service can create privacy risks when individuals are not expecting or comfortable with the additional processing. CSPs can determine appropriate measures commensurate with the privacy risk arising from the additional processing. For example, absent applicable law, regulation or policy, it may not be necessary to get explicit consent when processing attributes to provide non-identity services requested by subscribers, although notices may help subscribers maintain reliable assumptions about the processing (predictability). Other processing of attributes may carry different privacy risks that call for obtaining explicit consent or allowing subscribers more control over the use or disclosure of specific attributes (manageability). Subscriber consent needs to be meaningful; therefore, when CSPs do use consent measures, they cannot make acceptance by the subscriber of additional uses a condition of providing the identity service.\n\nConsult the SAOP if there are questions about whether the proposed processing falls outside the scope of the permitted processing or the appropriate privacy risk mitigation measures.\n\n[Section 5.2](#page22) also encourages the use of technical measures to provide disassociability (enabling the processing of PII or events without association to individuals or devices beyond the operational requirements of the system) and prevent subscriber activity tracking and profiling [[NISTIR8062](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8062)]. Technical measures, such as those outlined in [Section 5.1.4](#page21) for proxied federation and [Section 6.3](#page27) for pairwise pseudonymous identifiers, can increase the effectiveness\nof policies by making it more difficult to track or profile subscribers beyond operational requirements. </br><br># Source: nist 800-63c-3<br># URL: <a href='https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63c.pdf'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Passwords </br><br># Content: Typical UsageUsers often manually input the password (sometimes referred to as a passphrase or PIN). Alternatively, they may use a password manager to assist in the selection of a secure password and in maintaining distinct passwords for each authenticated service. The use of distinct passwords is important to avoid “password stuffing” attacks in which an attacker uses a compromised password from one site on other sites where the user might also have an account. Agencies should carefully evaluate password managers before making recommendations or mandates to confirm that they meet expectations for secure implementation.Usability considerations for typical usage without a password manager include:Memorability of the password          The likelihood of a recall failure increases as there are more items for users to remember. With fewer passwords, users can more easily recall the specific password needed for a particular RP.      The memory burden is greater for a less frequently used password.      User experience during entry of the password          Support copy and paste functionality in fields for entering passwords, including passphrases.      Intermittent EventsUsability considerations for intermittent events include:When users create and change passwords          Clearly communicate information on how to create and change passwords.      Clearly communicate password requirements, as specified in Sec. 3.1.1.      Allow at least 64 characters in length to support the use of passphrases. Encourage users to make passwords as lengthy as they want and use any characters that they like (including spaces) to aid memorization. Ensure that user interfaces support sufficient password lengths.      Do not impose other composition rules (e.g., mixtures of different character types) on passwords.      Do not require that passwords be changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically) unless there is a user request or evidence of authenticator compromise (see Sec. 3.1.1 for additional information).      Provide clear, meaningful, and actionable feedback when chosen passwords are rejected (e.g., when it appears on a “blocklist” of unacceptable passwords or has been used previously). </br><br># Source: nist 800-63b-4<br># URL: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Front-Channel Presentation </br><br># Content: In the front-channel presentation model shown in Fig. 12, the IdP creates an assertion and sends it to the RP by means of a third party, such as the subscriber’s user agent. In the implicit flow and some forms of the hybrid flow of [OIDC], the assertion (the ID Token) is presented in the front channel.  In the SAML Web SSO profile defined in [SAML-WebSSO], the SAML assertion is presented in the front channel.Fig. 12. Front-channel PresentationFront-channel presentation methods expose the assertion to parties other than the IdP and RP, which increases the risk for leakage of PII and other information included in the assertion. Additionally, there is an increased attack surface for the assertion to be captured and replayed by an attacker. As a consequence, it is recommended to not use front-channel presentation when other mechanisms are available.The RP SHALL use the assertion identifier ensure that a given assertion is presented at most once during the assertion’s validity time window.The RP SHALL protect itself against injection of manufactured or captured assertion by the use of cross-site scripting protection, rejecting assertions outside of the correct stage of a federation transaction, or other accepted techniques discussed in Sec. 3.10.1.Conveyance of the assertion from the IdP to the subscriber, as well as from the subscriber to the RP, SHALL be made over an authenticated protected channel.With general-purpose IdPs, it is common for front-channel communications to be accomplished using HTTP redirects, where the contents of the assertion are made available as part of an HTTP request URL. Due to the nature of the HTTP ecosystem, these request URLs are sometimes available in unexpected places, such as access logs and browser history. These logs and other artifacts tend to live on long past the federation transaction and are available in other contexts, which increases the attack surface for reading the assertion. As a consequence, an IdP that uses HTTP redirects for front channel presentation of assertions that contain PII SHALL encrypt the assertion as discussed in Sec 3.12.3. </br><br># Source: nist 800-63c-4<br># URL: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Healthcare IT professionals have a new instrument in their toolbox.\n\nThe hospital is a vast ecosystem comprised of an entire network of devices, equipment and systems that often require connection to external systems, making monitoring and control a very hard task to do. This is due to the high sensitivity of medical data and the potential vulnerability the sector is faced with (see:\nTwo thirds of healthcare organisations suffered cybersecurity incident in 2019\n), cybersecurity has to be applied every step of the way to ensure patient data privacy and the availability and resilience of healthcare services at the same time.\nA cybersecurity procurement guide for Hospitals\nThe ‘\nProcurement Guidelines for Cybersecurity in Hospitals\n’ published by the Agency is designed to support the healthcare sector in taking informative decisions on cybersecurity when purchasing new hospital assets. It provides the information to be included in the procurement requests that hospitals publish in order to obtain IT equipment.\nThis new report outlines good practices and recommendations for including cybersecurity as a provision in the procurement process in hospitals. Initially the report presents the set of hospital assets and the most prominent cybersecurity threats linked to them. After categorising the procurement process in three steps, namely ‘Plan, Source and Manage’, it identifies the cybersecurity requirements associated with each step. To make this even easier, the guide provides suggestions for evidence on how the requirements can be fulfilled by the provider.\nThe EU Agency for Cybersecurity, Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, stated:\n“\nProtecting patients and ensuring the resilience of our hospitals are a key part of the Agency’s work to make Europe’s health sector cyber secure”\nWho can use the Guide?\nThis guide provides an accessible overview and allows reutilisation by CIOs and CISOs of healthcare providers, medical device manufacturers, insurers and other healthcare related organisations, with the objective of becoming a useful reference. The visualisation of this information into a handy tool will be released in the coming months.\nThe Agency is supporting the healthcare sector to raise cybersecurity capacity and awareness since 2015; issuing several good practice guides, organising dedicated cybersecurity conferences and supporting policy implementation i.e. NIS Directive, Medical Device Regulation, (see:\nNew Medical Device Coordination Group Guidance on Cybersecurity for Medical Devices\n).

Identity Proofing Requirements<br>Subsection: 3.1.11Requirements for the Use of Biometrics </br><br># Content: Biometrics is the automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and behavioral characteristics such as, but not limited to, fingerprints, voice patterns, or facial features (biological characteristics), and keystroke patterns, angle of holding a smart phone, screen pressure, typing speed, mouse movements, or gait (behavioral characteristics). As used in these guidelines, biometric data refers to any analog or digital representation of biological and behavioral characteristics at any stage of their capture, storage, or processing. This includes live biometric samples from applicants (e.g., facial images, fingerprint), as well as biometric references obtained from evidence (e.g., facial image on a driver’s license, fingerprint minutiae template on identification cards). As applied to the identity proofing process, CSPs can use biometrics to verify that an individual is the rightful subject of identity evidence, to bind an individual to a new piece of identity evidence or credential, or for the purposes of fraud detection.\n\nThe following requirements apply to CSPs that employ biometrics as part of their identity proofing process:\n\n1. CSPs SHALL provide clear, publicly available information about all uses of biometrics, what biometric data is collected, how it is stored, how it is protected, and information on how to remove biometric information consistent with applicable laws and regulations.\n2. CSPs SHALL collect an explicit biometric consent from all applicants before collecting biometric information.\n3. CSPs SHALL store a record of subscriber’s consent for biometric use and associate it with subscriber’s account.\n4. CSPs SHALL have a documented, and publicly available, deletion process and default retention period for all biometric information.\n5. CSPs SHALL support the deletion of all of a subscriber’s biometric information upon the subscriber’s request at any time, except where otherwise restricted by regulation, law, or statute.\n6. CSPs SHALL have their biometric algorithms periodically tested by independent entities (e.g., accredited laboratories or research institutions) for their performance characteristics, including performance across demographic groups. At a minimum, the CSP SHALL have an algorithm retested after it has been updated.\n7. CSPs SHALL assess the performance and demographic impacts of employed biometric technologies in conditions that are substantially similar to the operational environment and user base of the system. The user base is defined by both the demographic characteristics of the expected users as well as the devices they are expected to use. When such assessments include real-world users, participation by users SHALL be voluntary.\n8. CSPs SHALL meet the following minimum performance thresholds for biometric usage in verification scenarios:\nFalse match rate: 1:10,000 or better; and\nFalse non-match rate: 1:100 or better\n9. CSPs MAY use 1:N matching in support of resolution or fraud detection, pursuant to a privacy risk assessment. In 1:N scenarios, CSPs SHALL meet a minimum performance threshold for false positive identifications of 1:1,000. This applies to, and SHALL be tested for, each demographic group. Tests demonstrating this requirement SHALL employ a gallery no smaller than 90% of the current or intended operational size (N).\n10. CSPs that make use of 1:N biometric matching for either resolution or fraud prevention purposes SHALL NOT decline a user’s enrollment without a manual review by a trained proofing agent or trusted referee to confirm the automated matching results and confirm the results are not a false positive identification (for example, twins submitting for different accounts with the same CSP).\n11. CSPs SHALL employ biometric technologies that provide similar performance characteristics for applicants of different demographic groups (age, race, sex, etc.). If significant performance differences across demographic groups are discovered, CSPs SHALL act expeditiously to provide redress options to affected individuals and to close performance gaps.\n12. All biometric performance tests SHALL be conformant to ISO/IEC 19795-1:2021 and ISO/IEC 19795-10:2024, including demographics testing.\n13. CSPs SHALL make performance and operational test results publicly available.\nThe following requirements apply to CSPs who collect biometric characteristics from applicants:\n\n1. CSP SHALL collect biometrics in such a way that provides reasonable assurance that the biometric is collected from the applicant, and not another subject.\n2. When collecting and comparing biometrics remotely, the CSP SHALL implement presentation attack detection (PAD) capabilities, which meet IAPAR performance metric <0.15, to confirm the genuine presence of a live human being and to mitigate spoofing and impersonation attempts.\n3. When collecting biometrics onsite, the CSP SHALL have the operator view the biometric source (e.g., fingers, face) for the presence of non-natural materials and perform such inspections as part of the proofing process. All biometric presentation attack detection tests SHALL be conformant to ISO/IEC 30107-3:2023 </br><br># Source: nist 800-63a-4<br># URL: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Digital Identity Risk Management<br>Subsection: 3.4 Tailor and Document Assurance Levels </br><br># Content: The second dimension of risk addressed by the Digital Identity Risk Management process focuses on risks from the identity management system. These risks inform the tailoring process and seeks to identify the risks and unintended consequences that result from the initial selection of xALs and the related technical and process controls in Sec. 3.3.4. Tailoring provides a process to modify an initially assessed assurance level and implement compensating or supplemental controls based on ongoing detailed risk assessments. It provides a pathway for flexibility and enables organizations to achieve risk management objectives that align with their specific context, users, and threat environment. This process focuses on assessing for unintended risks and equity, privacy, and usability impacts, and specific environmental threats. It does not prioritize any specific risk area or outcomes for agencies. Making decisions that balance different types of risks to meet organizational outcomes remains the responsibility of organizations.  Organizations SHOULD employ tailoring with the objective of aligning of digital identity controls to their specific context, users, and threat environment. Within the tailoring step, organizations SHALL focus on impacts to mission delivery due to the implementation of identity management controls that result in disproportionate impact on marginalized or historically underserved populations. Organizations SHALL consider not only the possibility of certain intended subjects failing to access the online service, but also the burdens, frustrations, and frictions experienced as a result of the identity management controls. As a part of the tailoring process, organizations SHALL review the impact assessment documentation and practice statements1 from CSPs and IdPs that they use or intend to use. However, organizations SHALL also conduct their own analysis to ensure that the organization’s specific mission and the communities being served by the online service are given due consideration for tailoring purposes. As a result the organization may require their chosen CSP to strengthen or provide optionality in the implementation of certain controls to address risks and unintended impacts to the organization’s mission and the communities served. To promote interoperability and consistency across organizations, third-party CSPs SHOULD implement their (assessed or tailored) xALs consistent with the normative guidance in this document. However, these guidelines provide flexibility to allow organizations to tailor the initial xALs and related controls to meet specific mission needs, address unique risk appetites, and provide secure and accessible online services. In doing so, CSPs MAY offer and organizations MAY utilize tailored sets of controls that differ from the normative statements in this guidance. Therefore, organizations SHALL establish and document an xAL tailoring process. At a minimum this process: <br> - SHALL follow a documented governance approach to allow for decision-making. <br> - SHALL document all decisions in the tailoring process, including the assessed xALs, modified xALs, and supplemental and compensating controls in the Digital Identity Acceptance Statement (see Sec. 3.4.4). <br> - SHALL justify and document all risk-based decisions or modifications to the initially assessed xALs in the Digital Identity Acceptance Statement (see Sec. 3.4.4). <br> - SHOULD establish a cross-functional capability to support subject matter analysis of xAL selection impacts in the tailoring process (e.g., subject matter experts who can speak about risks and considerations related to privacy, usability, fraud and impersonation impacts, equity, and other germane areas). <br> - SHOULD be a continuous process that incorporates real-world operational data to evaluate the impacts of selected xAL controls. The tailoring process promotes a structured means of balancing risks and impacts in the furtherance of protecting online services, systems, and data in a manner that enables mission success while supporting equity, privacy, and usability for individuals. </br><br># Source: nist 800-63-4<br># URL: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

This does not alter the user's traffic in any way, and the proxy connection can be severed as soon as the browser is closed. The adversary assumes the security context of whichever browser process the proxy is injected into. Browsers typically create a new process for each tab that is opened and permissions and certificates are separated accordingly. With these permissions, an adversary could potentially browse to any resource on an intranet, such as \n or webmail, that is accessible through the browser and which the browser has sufficient permissions. Browser pivoting may also bypass security provided by 2-factor authentication., <strong>Source</strong>: MITRE <br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1185'>Link Document</a> </br>", "2018", 1]

The operation was coordinated by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA). One of those arrested is Maksim Silnikau, 38, who used the online alias “JP Morgan.” He was extradited from Poland to the United States in August 2024 to face charges related to international computer hacking and wire fraud.  The group was involved in the development and distribution of ransomware such as Reveton and the Angler Exploit Kit, which affected hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide.  Reveton, in particular, launched in 2011, is known as one of the first ransomware-as-a-service operations and reportedly earned the group as much as $400,000 per month.  Silnikau is also charged in connection with operating the Ransom Cartel ransomware, starting in May 2021, and using hidden websites to track and control ransomware attacks. If convicted on all counts, Silnikau could face more than 50 years in prison.

The RP is the party that receives and uses the information provided by the IdP.\n\nFederated identity systems use assertions to accomplish this task. Assertions are statements from an IdP to an RP that contain information about a subscriber. Federation technology is generally used when the RP and the IdP are not a single entity or are not under common administration. The RP uses the information in the assertion to identify the subscriber and make authorization decisions about their access to resources controlled by the RP. An assertion typically includes an identifier for the subscriber, allowing association of the subscriber with their previous interactions with the RP. Assertions may additionally include attribute values or attribute references that further characterize the subscriber and support the authorization decision at the RP. Additional attributes may also be available outside of the assertion as part of the larger federation protocol. These attribute values and attribute references are often used in determining access privileges for Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) or facilitating a transaction (e.g., shipping address).\n\nIn a federated identity scenario, the subscriber does not authenticate directly to the RP. Instead, the federation protocol defines a mechanism for an IdP to generate an assertion for the identifier associated with a subscriber, usually in response to a request from the RP. The IdP is responsible for authenticating the subscriber (though it may use session management as described in [SP 800-63B,](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b) Section 7). This process allows the subscriber to obtain services from multiple RPs without the need to hold or maintain separate credentials at each. This process can also be used to support single sign on, where subscribers authenticate once to an IdP and subsequently obtain services from multiple RPs.\n\nFederation requires relatively complex multiparty protocols that have subtle security and privacy requirements and require careful consideration. When evaluating a particular federation structure, it may be instructive to break it down into its component interactions. Generally speaking, authentication between the subscriber and the IdP will be based on the authentication mechanisms presented in SP 800-63B, while interactions between the IdP and RP will convey attributes established using procedures in SP 800-63A and other self-asserted attributes. Many of the requirements presented in this document, therefore, have some relationship with corresponding requirements in those two documents.\n\nThe following table states which sections of the document are normative and which are informative:\n\n| **#** | **Section Name**                             | **Normative/Informative** |\n|-------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| 1.    | Purpose                                      | Informative               |\n| 2.    | Introduction                                 | Informative               |\n| 3.    | Definitions and Abbreviations                | Informative               |\n| 4.    | Federation Assurance Level (FAL)             | Normative                 |\n| 5.    | Federation                                   | Normative                 |\n| 6.    | Assertion                                    | Normative                 |\n| 7.    | Assertion Presentation                       | Normative                 |\n| 8.    | Security                                     | Informative               |\n| 9.    | Privacy Considerations                       | Informative               |\n| 10.   | Usability Considerations                     | Informative               |\n| 11.   | Examples                                     | Informative               |\n| 12.   | References                                   | Informative               | </br><br># Source: nist 800-63c-3<br># URL: <a href='https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63c.pdf'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as \n or \n.\nThe ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.\n Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.\nAn adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.\nThe ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.\nAdversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic.

Cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies has revealed phishing attacks attempting to exploit a vulnerability in the open-source webmail software Roundcube. Although Roundcube is not the most popular software, many government agencies still use it, making it a prime target for hackers. The attack begins with an email that appears to have no content, but contains hidden JavaScript code that allows hackers to access sensitive information. It exploits the vulnerability CVE-2024-37383, a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) security issue. Attackers can trick victims into opening a specially crafted email, causing JavaScript code to run that can access sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. This information is then sent to a server controlled by the hackers, hosted on Cloudflare. Currently, it is not clear who is behind the attacks, but Positive Technologies points out that hacker groups APT28, Winter Vivern, and TAG-70 have previously used similar vulnerabilities in Roundcube. This incident highlights the importance of keeping software up-to-date, as vulnerabilities discovered and patched as early as May 2024 can still easily lead to valuable data theft if not updated. <br><strong>Source</strong>: Thai-CERT<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/10/21/%e0%b8%9e%e0%b8%9a%e0%b9%81%e0%b8%ae%e0%b8%81%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%a3%e0%b9%8c%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%9b%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%b0%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%8a%e0%b8%99%e0%b9%8c%e0%b8%88/'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 1]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 372/67 (IT) Tuesday, October 22, 2024. Researchers from ETH Zurich discovered serious encryption problems in cloud storage platforms using end-to-end encryption (E2EE), which could lead to the leakage of sensitive user data.  This report indicates that 5 major providers, such as Sync, pCloud, Icedrive, Seafile, and Tresorit, all have vulnerabilities found in their cloud storage processes. Researchers Jonas Hofmann and Kien Tuong Truong explained that \"malicious servers could be used to interfere with or modify file data, including accessing user data in plain text.\"  The vulnerabilities found involve various attack methods such as file insertion, metadata modification, and authentication bypass, impacting the confidentiality and security of user data. Furthermore, these attacks do not require advanced cryptographic skills, making them easy to execute even by attackers with limited resources.  Sync, pCloud, Seafile, and Tresorit have acknowledged the report and are working on fixes. Icedrive, however, has chosen not to take action, despite the disclosure in late April 2024.

Researchers from Patchstack have warned of a serious vulnerability in the LiteSpeed Cache plugin for WordPress, which is used by more than 5 million websites.  The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-44000, has a CVSS score of 7.5 and could allow unauthenticated attackers to take control of user accounts and escalate privileges to administrator. The flaw is caused by a cookie leak in WordPress debug log files, which allows attackers to use this information to log into the website with a valid user session. However, this vulnerability only occurs when the debug feature is enabled, which is disabled by default in WordPress.  For mitigation, users should update the LiteSpeed Cache plugin to version 6.5.0.1, which addresses this issue.  Additionally, old log files that may contain leaked cookie information should be deleted. Direct access to log files should also be prevented.  Updating and patching vulnerabilities is crucial for ensuring secure WordPress usage. <br><strong>Source</strong>: Thai-CERT<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/09/10/%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%95%e0%b8%b7%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%9c%e0%b8%b9%e0%b9%89%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%89-wordpress-%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%87%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a7%e0%b9%88%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%99/'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 1]

Exportability <strong>Content</strong>: Exportability is the ability of an authenticator to share its authentication secret (either a private or symmetric key) with another endpoint or authenticator. Generally, endpoints with access to the authentication secret are considered exportable since software (perhaps malware) on the endpoint could access and leak the authentication secret. Non-exportable authenticators are considered more secure, and accordingly, a non-exportable cryptographic authenticator is required at AAL3. Syncable authenticators are inherently exportable (see Appendix B).To be considered non-exportable, an authenticator SHALL either be a separate piece of hardware or an embedded processor or execution environment (e.g., secure element, TEE, or trusted platform module). These hardware authenticators and embedded processors are separate from a host processor, such as the CPU on a laptop or mobile device. A non-exportable authenticator SHALL be designed to prohibit the export of the authentication secret to the host processor and SHALL NOT be capable of being reprogrammed by the host processor to allow the secret to be extracted. The authenticator is subject to applicable [FIPS140] requirements of the AAL at which the authenticator is being used, including applicable tamper resistance requirements.Invalidation can take several forms, including revocation of a PKI-based authenticator and removal from the subscriber account. ↩Federal enterprise systems include those considered in scope for PIV guidance, such as government contractors, government employees, and mission partners.

They are famous for their diversity of functions; a smartphone can be a contactless wallet, a camera/videophone, a barcode reader, an email client, or a way of accessing social networks.\n“\nGiven the growing importance of smartphones for EU businesses, governments and citizens, we consider it essential to assess their security and privacy implications\n.” says Prof. Dr.Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of .\nIn its new report,  analyses the key security opportunities and risks. Some of the key risks are:\n• Accidental leakage of sensitive data –e.g. through GPS data attached to images.\n• Data theft by malicious apps and from stolen, lost or decommissioned phones.\n•  “Diallerware” – malicious software which steals money through unauthorised phonecalls.\n• Overload of network infrastructure by smartphone applications.\nIn terms of opportunities, backup is often very well integrated into smartphone platforms, making it easy to recover data if the phone is lost or stolen. Another opportunity lies in the use of app-stores: “\nMost smartphone users only install 3rd party software through controlled software distribution channels.\n” says Dr. Marnix Dekker, co-author of the report.\nThe most important result of the report is a comprehensive set of strategies for securing smartphones. “Smartphones\nare a goldmine of sensitive and personal information – it’s vital to understand how to maintain our control over this data.

As a result, the attacker can bypass access controls (such as firewalls) or hide the source of malicious requests, since the requests would not be coming directly from the attacker.\nSince proxy functionality and message-forwarding often serve a legitimate purpose, this issue only becomes a vulnerability when:\nThe product runs with different privileges or on a different system, or otherwise has different levels of access than the upstream component;\nThe attacker is prevented from making the request directly to the target; and\nThe attacker can create a request that the proxy does not explicitly intend to be forwarded on the behalf of the requester. Such a request might point to an unexpected hostname, port number, hardware IP, or service. Or, the request might be sent to an allowed service, but the request could contain disallowed directives, commands, or resources.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nEnforce the use of strong mutual authentication mechanism between the two parties.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nWhenever a product is an intermediary or proxy for transactions between two other components, the proxy core should not drop the identity of the initiator of the transaction. The immutability of the identity of the initiator must be maintained and should be forwarded all the way to the target.\n<br><strong>Source</strong>: OWASP<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/441.html'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Ensuring users are as prepared as possible for their enrollment sessions is critical to the overall success and usability of the enrollment and identity proofing process.\n\nSuch preparation is only possible if users receive the necessary information (e.g., required documentation) in a usable format in an appropriate timeframe. This includes making users aware of exactly what identity evidence will be required. Users do not need to know anything about IALs or whether the identity evidence required is scored as “fair,” “strong,” or “superior,” whereas organizations need to know what IAL is required for access to a particular system.\n\nTo ensure users are equipped to make informed decisions about whether to proceed with the enrollment process, and what will be needed for their session, provide users:\n\n* Information about the entire process, such as what to expect in each step\n  1. Clear explanations of the expected timeframes to allow users to plan accordingly.\n* Explanation of the need for — and benefits of — identity proofing to allow users to understand the value proposition.\n* Information on the monetary amount and acceptable forms of payment, and if there is an enrollment fee. Offering a larger variety of acceptable forms of payment allows users to choose their preferred payment operation.\n* Information on whether the user’s enrollment session will be in-person or in-person over remote channels, and whether a user can choose. Only provide information relevant to the allowable session option(s).\n  1. Information on the location(s), whether a user can choose their preferred location, and necessary logistical information for in-person or in-person over remote channels session. Note that users may be reluctant to bring identity evidence to\n\ncertain public places (bank versus supermarket), as they perceive that it increases exposure to loss or theft.\n\n1. Information on the technical requirements (e.g., requirements for internet access) for remote sessions.\n   1. An option to set an appointment for in-person or in-person over remote channels identity proofing sessions to minimize wait times. If walk-ins are allowed, make it clear to users that their wait times may be greater without an appointment.\n      * Provide clear instructions for setting up an enrollment session appointment, reminders, and how to reschedule existing appointments.\n      * Offer appointment reminders and allow users to specify their preferred appointment reminder format(s) (e.g., postal mail, voicemail, email, text message). Users need information such as date, time, location, and a description of required identity evidence.\n\n* Information on the allowed and required identity evidence and attributes, whether each piece is voluntary or mandatory, and the consequences for not providing the complete set of identity evidence. Users need to know the specific combinations of identity evidence, including requirements specific to a piece of identity evidence (e.g., a raised seal on a birth certificate). This is especially important due to potential difficulties procuring the necessary identity evidence.\n  1. Where possible, implement tools to make it easier to obtain the necessary identity evidence.\n\n1. Inform users of any special requirements for minors and people with unique needs. For example, provide users with the information necessary to use trusted referees, such as a notary, legal guardian, or some other form of certified individual that can legally vouch for or act on behalf of the individual (see [Section](#page31)\n\n[5.3.4](#page31)).\n\n1. If forms are required:\n   * Provide fillable forms before and at the enrollment session. Do not require users to have access to a printer.\n\n* Minimize the amount of information users must enter on a form, as users are easily frustrated and more error-prone with longer forms.

[9.118683815002441, 14.069632530212402, "<strong>Section</strong>: Threats and Security Considerations <strong>Subsection</strong>: 10.1. Authenticator Threats <strong>Content</strong>: An attacker who can gain control of an authenticator will often be able to masquerade as the authenticator’s owner. Threats to authenticators can be categorized based on attacks on the types of authentication factors that comprise the authenticator:    “Something you know” may be disclosed to an attacker. For example, the attacker may guess a password. If the authenticator is a shared secret, the attacker could access the CSP or verifier and obtain the secret value or perform a dictionary attack on a hash of that value. An attacker may observe the entry of a PIN or passcode, find a written record or journal entry of a PIN or passcode, or install malicious software (e.g., a keyboard logger) to capture the secret. Additionally, an attacker may determine the secret through offline attacks on a password database maintained by the verifier.      “Something you have” may be lost, damaged, stolen from the owner, or cloned by an attacker. For example, an attacker who gains access to the owner’s computer may copy a software authenticator. A hardware authenticator may be stolen, tampered with, or duplicated. Out-of-band secrets may be intercepted by an attacker and used to authenticate their own session. A subscriber may be socially engineered to provide access to secrets without intentional collusion.      “Something you are” may be replicated. For example, an attacker may obtain a copy of the subscriber’s fingerprint and construct a replica.  Subscribers sometimes collude with attackers, and virtually nothing can be done from an authentication perspective to prevent these attacks. With this caveat in mind, threats to the authenticators used for digital authentication are listed in Table 2 along with some examples.\n\nTable 2. Authenticator threats\n\n| Authenticator Threat/Attack | Description | Examples |\n|----------------------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Theft | An attacker steals a physical authenticator. | - A hardware cryptographic authenticator is stolen.<br>- An OTP authenticator is stolen.<br>- A look-up secret authenticator is stolen.<br>- A cell phone is stolen. |\n| Duplication | The subscriber's authenticator has been copied with or without their knowledge. | - Passwords written on paper are disclosed.<br>- Passwords stored in an electronic file are copied.<br>- A vulnerability in an insufficiently secure password manager is exploited.<br>- A software PKI authenticator (i.e., private key) is copied.<br>- A Look-up secret authenticator is copied.<br>- A counterfeit biometric authenticator is manufactured.<br>- Exportable cryptographic keys are obtained from a device or cloud-based sync fabric. |\n| Eavesdropping | The attacker observes the authenticator secret or authenticator output as the subscriber is authenticating.<br><br>The attacker intercepts an out-of-band secret by compromising the communication channel. | - Passwords are obtained by watching keyboard entries.<br>- Passwords or authenticator outputs are intercepted by keystroke logging software.<br>- A PIN is captured from a PIN pad device.<br>- A hashed password is obtained and used by an attacker for another authentication (i.e., pass-the-hash attack).<br>- An out-of-band secret is transmitted via unencrypted Wi-Fi and received by the attacker. |\n| Offline Cracking | The authenticator is exposed using analytical methods outside of the authentication mechanism. | - A software PKI authenticator is subjected to a dictionary attack to identify the correct password to decrypt the private key. |\n| Side-Channel Attack | The authenticator's secret is exposed using the physical characteristics of the authenticator. | - A key is extracted by differential power analysis on a hardware cryptographic authenticator.<br>- A cryptographic authenticator secret is extracted by analysis of the authenticator's response time over several attempts. |\n| Phishing or Pharming | The authenticator output is captured by fooling the claimant into thinking that the attacker is a verifier or RP. | - A claimant reveals a password to a website impersonating the verifier.<br>- A password is revealed by a bank subscriber in response to an email inquiry from a phisher pretending to represent the bank.<br>- A password is revealed by the claimant at a bogus verifier website reached through DNS spoofing. |\n| Social Engineering | The attacker establishes a level of trust with a subscriber to convince them to reveal their authenticator secret or authenticator output. | - A password is revealed by the subscriber to an officemate asking for the password on behalf of the subscriber's boss.<br>- A password is revealed by a subscriber in a telephone inquiry from an attacker masquerading as a system administrator.<br>- An attacker who has convinced the mobile operator to redirect the victim's mobile phone to them receives an out-of-band secret sent via SMS.<br>- A subscriber erroneously approves a push-based authentication request coming from a repeated \"fatigue\" attack. |\n| Online Guessing | The attacker connects to the verifier online and attempts to guess a valid authenticator output in the context of that verifier. | -

Digital Identity Risk Management <strong>Subsection</strong>: 3.4.1 Assess Privacy, Equity, Usability and Threat Resistance <strong>Content</strong>: When selecting and tailoring assurance levels for specific online services, it is critical that insights and inputs to the process extend beyond the initial impact assessment in Sec. 3.2. When transitioning from the initial assurance level selection in Sec. 3.3.4 to the final xAL selection and implementation, organizations SHALL conduct detailed assessments of the controls defined for the initially selected xALs to identify potential impacts in the operational environment. At a minimum, organizations SHALL assess the impacts and potential unintended consequences related to the following areas: <br> - Privacy – Identify unintended consequences to the privacy of individuals that will be subject to the controls at an assessed xAL and of individuals affected by organizational or third-party practices related to the establishment, management, or federation of a digital identity. Privacy assessments SHOULD leverage existing Privacy Threshold Assessments (PTAs) and Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) as inputs to the privacy assessment process. However, as the goal of the privacy assessment is to identify privacy risks that arise from the initial assurance level selection, additional assessments and evaluations that are specific to the baseline controls for the assurance levels may be required for the underlying information system. <br> - Equity – Determine whether implementation of the initial assurance levels may create, maintain, or exacerbate inequities across communities. Equity assessments SHALL evaluate impacts on the communities being served by considering factors such as: proficiency with and access to technology, the availability of end devices with required technical capabilities (e.g., cameras), shared computing or device scenarios, housing status, access to internet, internet speed, family income bracket, credit score, disability status, sex, skin tone, age, native language, English fluency, and education. The intent of this assessment is to mitigate potential impacts on marginalized and historically underserved groups and limit disproportionate impacts from the requirements of the identity management functions. <br> - Usability – Determine whether implementation of the initial assurance levels will result in challenges to the end-user experience. Usability assessments SHALL consider usability impacts that result from the identity management controls to ensure that they do not cause undue burdens, frustrations, or frictions for the communities served and that there are pathways to provide accessibility to users of all capabilities. <br> - Threat Resistance – Determine whether the defined assurance level and related controls will address specific threats to the online service based on the operational environment, its threat actors, and known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Threat assessments SHALL consider specific and known threats, threat actors, and TTPs within the implementation environment for the identity management functions. For example, certain benefits programs may be more subject to familial threats or collusion. Supplemental controls MAY need to be implemented to address specific threats within communities served by the online service. Conversely, agencies MAY tailor their assessed xAL down or modify their baseline controls if their threat assessment indicates that a reduced threat posture is appropriate based on their environment. Organizations SHOULD leverage consultation and feedback to ensure that the tailoring process addresses the constraints of the entities and communities served.  Organizations MAY establish mechanisms through which civil society organizations that work with marginalized groups can provide input on the impacts felt or likely to be felt. Additionally, organizations SHOULD conduct additional business-specific assessments as appropriate to fully represent mission- and domain-specific considerations not captured here. These assessments SHALL be extended to any compensating or supplemental controls as defined in Sec. 3.4.2 and Sec. 3.4.3. The outcome of this step is a set of risk assessments for privacy, equity, usability, threat resistance and other dimensions that informs the tailoring of the initial assurance levels and the selection of compensating and supplemental controls.<br><strong>Source</strong>: nist 800-63-4 </br><br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Annual Privacy Forum 2019: Call for papers\nThe  Annual Privacy Forum (APF) is a conference, organised yearly, on the conjuncture of information security and privacy that brings together contributions from policy, research and the industry.\n\nThe APF 2019 will be held on 13-14 June 2019 in Rome, Italy, in co-operation with the University of Rome Tor Vergata and LUISS University.\nAlready in its seventh edition, the APF seeks to contribute to the implementation of information security in the area of privacy and personal data protection. The APF is set against the EU legislative background that mainly, but not exclusively, comprises the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the draft ePrivacy Regulation (ePR). The APF sets the stage for discussions of research proposals, solutions, models, applications and policies. In the last few years, the APF has also developed a deeper industry footprint, to complement its original research and policy orientation.\nPapers presenting original work on the themes of data protection and privacy and their repercussions on information security technology, business, government, law, research, society and policy are hereby invited. A multi-disciplinary approach is expected and encouraged to contribute to bridging the gap across disciplines and propose new models and interpretations. The APF seeks contributions from policy makers and implementers, Data Protection Authorities, industry, research, consultants, NGOs and the civil society, as it aims at broad stakeholders’ participation that stimulate interaction and exchange of opinion.\nTo promote participation of young researchers, the submission of papers by students is particularly welcome. These papers will be treated as thoroughly as full papers, but can be shorter and reflect novel thinking that might not have been fully elaborated just yet.\nIn addition to student papers, short papers are equally invited, as this call is open to sketchy ideas, opinion or a call for collaboration.\nPapers that pass reviewers’ scrutiny are likely to be included in the published proceedings, kindly supported by Springer (Lecture Notes in Computer Science series).\nThe deadline for submission is set to 11 January 2019.\nFor more information, please visit:\nhttps://privacyforum.eu/\nPrevious APF editions\n:\n Annual Privacy Forum 2018: shaping technology around data protection and privacy requirements\n Annual Privacy Forum 2017: security measures to bolster data protection and privacy\nPrivacy tools, security measures and evaluation of current technologies under the spotlight at this year’s Annual Privacy Forum\n2015 Annual Privacy Forum focusing on Privacy Enhancing Technologies\nAnnual Privacy Forum 2nd edition starts today in Athens\nSuccessful conclusion for the First Annual Privacy Forum<br><strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/submit-your-paper-annual-privacy-forum-2019-call-for-papers'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Digital Identity Risk Management <strong>Subsection</strong>: 5.3.1 Business Process vs. Online Transaction <strong>Content</strong>: The assurance level determination is only based on transactions that are part of a digital system.An online transaction may not be equivalent to a complete business process that requires offlineprocessing, or online processing in a completely segmented system. In selecting the appropriateassurance levels, the agency should assess the risk associated with online transactions they areoffering via the digital service, not the entire business process associated with the providedbenefit or service. For example, in an online survey, personal information may be collected, butit is never made available online to the submitter after the information is saved. In this instance,it is important for the information to be carefully protected in backend systems, but there is noreason to identity proof or even authenticate the user providing the information for the purposesof their own access to the system or its associated benefits. The online transaction is solely asubmission of the data. The entire business process may require a significant amount of datavalidation, without ever needing to know if the correct person submitted the information. In thisscenario, there is no need for any identity proofing nor authentication.Another example where the assessed risk could differ if the agency evaluated the entire businessprocess rather than the online transaction requirements is a digital service that accepts résumés toapply for open job postings. In this use case, the digital service allows an individual to submit –or at least does not restrict an individual from submitting – a résumé on behalf of anyone else,and in subsequent visits to the site, access the résumé for various purposes. Since the résuméinformation is available to the user in later sessions, and is likely to contain personal information,the agency must select an AAL that requires MFA, even though the user self-asserted thepersonal information. In this case, the requirements of [EO 13681] apply and the application must provide at least AAL2. However, the identity proofing requirements remain unclear. Theentire business process of examining a résumé and ultimately hiring and onboarding a personrequires a significant amount of identity proofing. The agency needs a high level of confidencethat the job applicant is in fact the subject of the résumé submitted online if a decision to hire ismade. Yet this level of proofing is not required to submit the résumé online. Identity proofing isnot required to complete the digital portion of the transaction successfully. Identity proofing thesubmitter would create more risk than required in the online system as excess personalinformation would be collected when no such information is needed for the portion of the hiringprocess served by the digital job application portal and may reduce usability. Therefore, the mostappropriate IAL selection would be 1. There is no need to identity proof the user to successfullycomplete the online transaction. This decision for the online portal itself is independent of aseemingly obvious identity proofing requirement for the entire business process, lest a job beoffered to a fraudulent applicant.<br><strong>Source</strong>: nist 800-63-3 </br><br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-3.pdf'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

In April, Frontier Communications notified the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had to shut down some systems after a cyberattack.  The incident was reported on April 14th after unauthorized Threat Actors gained access to parts of its IT environment. The company launched a data breach investigation, assisted by leading cybersecurity experts, and began containment efforts. Initially, the company did not provide details about the attack, but last week started notifying over 751,895 individuals that their personal information had been stolen. To assist affected customers, Frontier Communications is offering one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft resolution services to affected individuals and advises customers to be wary of scams or suspicious transactions. <br><strong>Source</strong>: Thai-CERT<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/06/11/%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%b0%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%94%e0%b8%82%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%b9%e0%b8%a5-frontier-communications-%e0%b8%aa%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%87%e0%b8%9c/'>Link Document</a></br>", "2024", 1]

Firms are provided a single point from which they can assess how to implement business continuity management within their organisations. This will enable them to identify potential NIS risks to critical business processes and the infrastructure needed to restore and keep them running. While the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore continue to be innovators in this field,  found little information on current practices in Central Europe. The report therefore equips other countries with knowledge about best practice from around the world and encourages the take-up of state-of-the-art solutions.\nBusiness continuity implies management processes and integrated plans which maintain the continuity of an organisation’s critical processes in the case of a disruptive event. There are a number of emerging, and overlapping, business continuity standards. ’s report utilises the knowledge of these various methods and tools, represents them on an overview process diagramme and compares them to enable organisations to understand which approach and infrastructure best suits their needs. In an effort to overcome the lack of common language across the different standards, the Agency has also produced a glossary which cross references different terms with similar elements.\nWhy is business continuity important?\nEmphasising the ever-increasing reliance on ICT in critical business processes, the Agency explains the integral role business continuity plays in good management practice and corporate governance:\n\"Disruptive incidents, such as malicious IT attacks or even a simple loss of critical data, call into question an organisation’s ability to continue to provide its key services. Business needs tools to mitigate risk and having an NIS business continuity plan is one step in the right direction.\"\nIn addition to being better prepared in the event of a crisis, business continuity has financial benefits. For example, many insurance companies offer discounts to firms with risk assessment and management plans while investors are more attracted to companies able to curb NIS risks.<br><strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/2008-prs/business-at-risk'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Their role is to manage the vulnerabilities of a company’s products and services.\nPSIRTs have been mostly developed in a heterogeneous way. For instance, while some of them are well developed and independent from the main Incident Response (IR) team of the host company, others belong to their Security Operations Centre (SOC) or are just part of the development team.\nWhy a report on CSIRTs and PSIRTs capabilities?\nThe Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NISD) adopted in 2016 provides legal measures to boost the level of cybersecurity in the EU. Both CSIRTs and PSIRTs are essential players in the global Incident Response (IR) ecosystem.\nThe study published today -\nPSIRT Expertise and Capabilities Development\n- provides recommendations on the role of PSIRTs in the IR setup of the Member States according to the NISD, specifically in the energy and health sectors.\n had already explored in details the IR setup across all sectors of the NISD in a study published in 2019: “\nEU Member States incident response development status report\n”.\nSectoral PSIRTs as energy or healthcare ones may benefit from an aligned approach in terms of processes and collaboration to ensure legal compliance in relation to their business partners, clients and possibly Operators of Essential Services or other actors subject to EU cybersecurity regulation.\nTarget audience\nBased on an extensive desk research and a survey addressed to 7 PSIRTs and 22 CSIRTs from 19 Member States, the report identifies 12 findings and discloses 9 recommendations addressed to:\nSectoral PSIRTs;\nSectoral CSIRTs;\nOperators of Essential Services (OES);\nSecurity Operations Centres.\nWhat are the key findings & key recommendations?\nThe recommendations issued are based on an in-depth analysis of the following elements:\nOrganisation, processes & tools;\nCollaboration;\nDevelopment & visibility.\nThe study highlights the following major challenges and related recommendations:\nDevelop a clearer role and visibility of PSIRTs\nThe exact role of PSIRTs or their specific activities are not always clear. Recommendations consist in developing communications with clients and encouraging stronger engagement with the Incident Reporting community through conferences and working groups.\nThe development of standardised documents based on partner expectations in relation to PSIRT policies, procedures and services offered could help improve the understanding of the services, the visibility of the PSIRT team and facilitate the vulnerability reporting process.\nImprove cooperation among PSIRTs\nChallenges are identified in relation to effective cooperation among the different stakeholders of the vulnerability ecosystem such as PSIRTs, CSIRTs, national and/or sectoral CSIRTs, end clients and OES.\nRecommendations include the development of technical standards to improve interoperability, automation and processes in order to streamline the exchange of sensitive information. This would especially make sense in order to meet the requirement of early notification in case of vulnerability disclosure.\nFind out about the other challenges and recommendations issued in the report published today.\nDownload the Report\nHow can  help?\nGenerally, both emerging and established PSIRTs consider it necessary for  to develop best practices, standards and harmonised certifications that PSIRTs could rely on to improve their efficiency.\nRecommended actions include the publication of guidelines and general security guidance.

RF communication frequencies vary between 3 kHz to 300 GHz, although are commonly between 300 MHz to 6 GHz. \n  The wavelength and frequency of the signal affect how the signal propagates through open air, obstacles (e.g. walls and trees) and the type of radio required to capture them. These characteristics are often standardized in the protocol and hardware and may have an effect on how the signal is captured. Some examples of wireless protocols that may be found in cyber-physical environments are: WirelessHART, Zigbee, WIA-FA, and 700 MHz Public Safety Spectrum. \nAdversaries may capture RF communications by using specialized hardware, such as software defined radio (SDR), handheld radio, or a computer with radio demodulator tuned to the communication frequency. \n Information transmitted over a wireless medium may be captured in-transit whether the sniffing device is the intended destination or not. This technique may be particularly useful to an adversary when the communications are not encrypted. \n \nIn the 2017 Dallas Siren incident, it is suspected that adversaries likely captured wireless command message broadcasts on a 700 MHz frequency during a regular test of the system.

To that purpose,  updated its CSIRT training material aimed at improving the skills of CSIRT teams. The scope of this new training is to adapt to new technologies and best practices in a fast changing domain.\nThe updated material will help to reinforce Member States CSIRTs’\noperational skills\nand capacities\n. It will specifically allow them to manage the constant stream of cyber security events in an efficient way by showing them how to introduce smartly interconnected popular tools in their incident handling processes: the first step of so-called “orchestration” of tools.\nAccess the \nOrchestration of CSIRT Tools Training Course\nThe purpose of the training is to educate  Member States by:\nteaching how some popular tools can be interconnected, leading to a more efficient and better incident response,\nautomatically enriching the information on incidents and events they receive and increasing the amount of data they can share back much faster to their peers.\nThe new training materials consist of\nindependent modules\n, each covering a particular combination of tools. The modules not only cover the configuration aspects of interconnecting the tools but also show how security analysts can use these orchestrated tools in their daily duties.\nThe underlying technical framework developed for this training allows modifying and extending the training courses to adapt to the fast evolving landscape of CSIRT tools and techniques. The training materials are therefore custom made  reusable and future-proof. This is a major novel change in approach to the technical trainings offered by .\nScope of the training\nThe training is divided in two parts, each with a different target audience.\nThe first -part is dedicated to the technical aspects of setting up the orchestration. It allows participants to practice with a selection of commonly used and very powerful open-source tools, such as:\nMISP\n; a Threat Intelligence Platform for receiving and sharing information with other security actors;\nTheHive\nand\nCortex\n: a case management and team collaboration tool;\nElasticsearch\nand\nKibana\n: for convenient and scalable storage of security data, query and visualisation purposes.\nThe second part deals with analytical workflows, focusing on leading simple investigations designed as training scenarios. Each of the scenarios demonstrates how the selection of tools can facilitate a typical CSIRT workflow. The emphasis is laid on the benefits that result from smartly interconnecting multiple CSIRT tools\nSupporting the CSIRT analysts;\nImproving the team’s situational awareness;\nReducing response times.\nEasy sharing of own findings with the other security communities of choice.\nAnother interesting feature is that the approach is modular: the trainer can instantly deploy different sections of the training independently.  The trainer can start with a module that teaches how to connect some tools, followed by an analysis scenario that demonstrates the added value of interconnecting. Every module can be instantly deployed with all tools correctly configured and all the data needed for the scenario in place.\nArchitecture of the Platform\nThe infrastructure of the training is based on state of the art open-source containerization and orchestration technologies such as\nKubernetes\nand\nHelm\n. This approach allows simplifying future continuous developments by adding new tools, rearranging existing ones and adding more analyst scenarios.\nMoreover, the solution can be adapted to work natively in a cloud hosted infrastructure; removing the need for local setup of the environment and streamlining the complete training process.\nIt was also conceived to be modular by design, allowing thorough customisation of training delivery.\nFurther information\n\nOrchestration of CSIRT Tools Training Course\nFor more information please contact\ncsirt-relations@.europa.eu<br><strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/csirt-training-tools-new-orchestration'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.\nAll forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this case, the malicious emails contain links. Generally, the links will be accompanied by social engineering text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser, leveraging \n. The visited website may compromise the web browser using an exploit, or the user will be prompted to download applications, documents, zip files, or even executables depending on the pretext for the email in the first place.\nAdversaries may also include links that are intended to interact directly with an email reader, including embedded images intended to exploit the end system directly. Additionally, adversaries may use seemingly benign links that abuse special characters to mimic legitimate websites (known as an \"IDN homograph attack\").\n URLs may also be obfuscated by taking advantage of quirks in the URL schema, such as the acceptance of integer- or hexadecimal-based hostname formats and the automatic discarding of text before an \"@\" symbol: for example, \n.\nAdversaries may also utilize links to perform consent phishing, typically with OAuth 2.0 request URLs that when accepted by the user provide permissions/access for malicious applications, allowing adversaries to  \ns.\n These stolen access tokens allow the adversary to perform various actions on behalf of the user via API calls. \nAdversaries may also utilize spearphishing links to \ns that grant immediate access to the victim environment. For example, a user may be lured through \"consent phishing\" into granting adversaries permissions/access via a malicious OAuth 2.0 request URL .\nSimilarly, malicious links may also target device-based authorization, such as OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow which is typically used to authenticate devices without UIs/browsers. Known as \"device code phishing,\" an adversary may send a link that directs the victim to a malicious authorization page where the user is tricked into entering a code/credentials that produces a device token. </br><br><strong>Source</strong>: MITRE </br><br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002/'>Link Document</a></br>", "2020", 1]

As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n# Extend Description : \nExtended Description\nImproper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.\nMost products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").\nIf an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nStrategy: Libraries or Frameworks\nUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.\nFor example, consider using the ESAPI Encoding control [\nREF-45\n] or a similar tool, library, or framework. These will help the programmer encode outputs in a manner less prone to error.\nAlternately, use built-in functions, but consider using wrappers in case those functions are discovered to have a vulnerability.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nStrategy: Parameterization\nIf available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.\nFor example, stored procedures can enforce database query structure and reduce the likelihood of SQL injection.\nPhases: Architecture and Design; Implementation\nUnderstand the context in which your data will be used and the encoding that will be expected. This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when generating outputs that can contain multiple encodings at the same time, such as web pages or multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations to determine the required encoding strategies.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nIn some cases, input validation may be an important strategy when output encoding is not a complete solution. For example, you may be providing the same output that will be processed by multiple consumers that use different encodings or representations. In other cases, you may be required to allow user-supplied input to contain control information, such as limited HTML tags that support formatting in a wiki or bulletin board. When this type of requirement must be met, use an extremely strict allowlist to limit which control sequences can be used. Verify that the resulting syntactic structure is what you expect. Use your normal encoding methods for the remainder of the input.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nUse input validation as a defense-in-depth measure to reduce the likelihood of output encoding errors (see\nCWE-20\n).\nPhase: Requirements\nFully specify which encodings are required by components that will be communicating with each other.\nPhase: Implementation\nWhen exchanging data between components, ensure that both components are using the same character encoding. Ensure that the proper encoding is applied at each interface. Explicitly set the encoding you are using whenever the protocol allows you to do so.\n<br><strong>Source</strong>: OWASP<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

This recommendation deals primarily with methods for making impersonation more difficult; however, it does prescribe certain methods and procedures that may help prove who perpetrated an impersonation. At each level, methods are employed to determine that a person with the claimed identity exists, that the applicant is the person entitled to the claimed identity, and that the applicant cannot later repudiate the enrollment. As the level of assurance increases, the methods employed provide increasing resistance to casual, systematic, and insider impersonation.

Privacy Considerations <strong>Subsection</strong>: 7.3 Use Limitation <strong>Content</strong>: The guidelines require CSPs to use measures to maintain the objectives of predictability (enabling reliable assumptions by individuals, owners, and operators about PII and its processing by an information system) and manageability (providing the capability for the granular administration of PII, including alteration, deletion, and selective disclosure) commensurate with privacy risks that can arise from the processing of attributes for purposes other than identity proofing, authentication, authorization, or attribute assertion, related fraud mitigation, or to comply with law or legal process. A framework for managing these risks and supporting privacy risk management principles can be found in [NISTIR8062].<br>CSPs may have various business purposes for processing attributes, including providing non-identity services to subscribers. However, processing attributes for other purposes than those disclosed to a subject can create additional privacy risks. CSPs can determine appropriate measures commensurate with the privacy risk arising from the additional processing. For example, absent applicable law, regulation, or policy, it may not be necessary to obtain consent when processing attributes to provide non-identity services requested by subscribers, although notices may help the subscribers maintain reliable assumptions about the processing (predictability). Other processing of attributes may carry different privacy risks which may call for obtaining consent or allowing subscribers more control over the use or disclosure of specific attributes (manageability). Subscriber consent needs to be meaningful; therefore, when CSPs do use consent measures, they cannot make acceptance by the subscriber of additional uses a condition of providing the identity service.<br>Federal agencies should consult their SAOP if there are questions about whether the proposed processing falls outside the scope of the permitted processing or the appropriate privacy risk mitigation measures.<br><strong>Source</strong>: nist 800-63a-4 </br><br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Sharing <strong>Content</strong>: Cybersecurity guidelines have historically cautioned against sharing authenticators between users, expecting different users to maintain their own unique authenticators. Despite this guidance, authenticator and password sharing occurs within some user groups and applications to allow individuals to share access to a digital account.As indicated in Table 5, some syncable authenticator implementations have embraced this user behavior and established methods for sharing authentication keys between different users. Further, some implementations actively encourage sharing syncable authenticators as a convenient and more secure alternative to sharing passwords for common services.For enterprise use cases, concerns over sharing keys can be effectively mitigated using device management techniques that limit the ability for keys to be moved off of approved devices or sync fabrics. However, similar mitigations are not currently available for public-facing use cases, leaving RPs dependent on the sharing models adopted by syncable authenticator providers. Owners of public-facing applications should be aware of the risks associated with shared authenticators. When interacting with the public, agencies have limited visibility into which specific authenticators are being employed by their users and should assume that all syncable authenticators may be subject to sharing. While many sharing models have substantial controls that minimize risks (e.g., requiring close proximity between devices to allow sharing), other implementations are less restrictive.The risk of sharing posed by this new class of authenticators is not unique. It applies to all authenticator types, some of which are weaker than syncable authenticators. Any authenticator can be shared by a user who is determined to share it. Users can actively share passwords, OTPs, out-of-band authenticators, and even push authentication events that allow a designee (whether formal or not) to authenticate on behalf of an end user.Agencies determine which authenticators they will accept for their applications based on the specific risks, threats, and usability considerations they face. Syncable authenticators may be offered as a new option for applications that seek to implement up to AAL2. The trade-offs of this technology should be well-balanced based on their expected outcomes for security, privacy, equity, and usability.<br><strong>Source</strong>: nist 800-63b-4 </br><br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Although this can be classified as an injection problem, the more pertinent issue is the improper conversion of such special characters to respective context-appropriate entities before displaying them to the user.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Implementation\nCarefully check each input parameter against a rigorous positive specification (allowlist) defining the specific characters and format allowed. All input should be neutralized, not just parameters that the user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected to be redisplayed by the site. We often encounter data from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer. Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Output Encoding\nUse and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.\nThe problem of inconsistent output encodings often arises in web pages. If an encoding is not specified in an HTTP header, web browsers often guess about which encoding is being used. This can open up the browser to subtle XSS attacks.\nPhase: Implementation\nWith Struts, write all data from form beans with the bean's filter attribute set to true.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Attack Surface Reduction\nTo help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be HttpOnly. In browsers that support the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie. This is not a complete solution, since HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers. More importantly, XMLHTTPRequest and other powerful browser technologies provide read access to HTTP headers, including the Set-Cookie header in which the HttpOnly flag is set.\nEffectiveness: Defense in Depth\n<br><strong>Source</strong>: OWASP<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Assertion Contents <strong>Content</strong>: An assertion is a packaged set of attribute values or derived attribute values about or associated with an authenticated subscriber that is passed from the IdP to the RP in a federated identity system. Assertions contain a variety of information, including: assertion metadata, attribute values and derived attribute values about the subscriber, information about the subscriber’s authentication at the IdP, and other information that the RP can leverage (e.g., restrictions and validity time window). While the assertion’s primary function is to authenticate the user to an RP, the information conveyed in the assertion can be used by the RP for a number of use cases — for example, authorization or personalization of a website. These guidelines do not restrict RP use cases nor the type of protocol or data payload used to federate an identity, provided that the chosen solution meets all mandatory requirements contained herein.Assertions SHALL represent a discrete authentication event of the subscriber at the IdP and SHALL be processed as a discrete authentication event at the RP.All assertions SHALL include the following attributes:All assertions SHALL contain sufficient information to determine the following aspects of the federation transaction:At FAL3, the assertion SHALL include one of the following:The public key, key identifier, or other identifier for a holder-of-key assertion, orAn indicator that verification of a bound authenticator is required to process this assertion.Assertions MAY also include additional items, including the following information:The RP SHALL validate the assertion by checking that all the following are true:Signature validation: ensuring that the signature of the assertion is valid and corresponds to a key belonging to the IdP sending the assertion.Issuer verification: ensuring that the assertion was issued by the IdP the RP expects it to be from.Time validation: ensuring that the expiration and issue times are within acceptable limits of the current timestamp.Audience restriction: ensuring that this RP is the intended recipient of the assertion.Nonce: ensuring that the cryptographic nonce included in the RP’s request (if applicable) is included in the presentation.Transaction terms: ensuring that the IAL, AAL, and FAL represented by the assertion are allowable under the applicable trust agreement.An RP SHALL treat subject identifiers as not inherently globally unique. Instead, the value of the assertion’s subject identifier is usually in a namespace under the assertion issuer’s control, as discussed in Sec. 3.3. This allows an RP to talk to multiple IdPs without incorrectly conflating subjects from different IdPs.Assertions MAY include additional attributes about the subscriber. Section 3.9 contains privacy requirements for presenting attributes in assertions. The RP MAY be given limited access to an identity API as discussed in Sec. 3.11.3, either in the same response as the assertion is received or through some other mechanism. The RP can use this API to fetch additional identity attributes for the subscriber that are not included in the assertion itself.The assertion’s validity time window is the time between its issuance and its expiration. This window needs to be large enough to allow the RP to process the assertion and create a local application session for the subscriber, but should not be longer than necessary for such establishment. Long-lived assertions have a greater risk of being stolen or replayed; a short assertion validity time window mitigates this risk. Assertion validity time windows SHALL NOT be used to limit the session at the RP.

This is significantly higher than the previous 3 years, when natural phenomena accounted for only 5% of the incidents. Natural phenomena will continue to be a concern for telecom providers across the EU, with extreme weather becoming more common due to climate change.\n62% of the telecom security incidents in 2017 were system failures, such as hardware failures, software bugs or faulty software updates. In all years prior to reporting, system failures accounted for 60% to 80% of total incidents.\nMore than half of the incidents reported have an impact on mobile telephony and internet in the EU. This confirms the shift of the last years. Fixed telephony was the most affected service only in the early years of reporting.\nWith 22% of incidents due to power cuts, dependency of telecoms on the power grid is clear. A common scenario starts with a storm or wildfire which causes a power cut, and leads to a mobile network outage soon after.\nOnly a small 2% of the incidents were due to malicious actions, such as denial of service attacks and cable theft. The year before, this was at 5%. The multi-annual trend for malicious actions has been below 10%.\nThe document gives an aggregated overview of the annual summary reports sent to  by the NRAs of the 28 EU Member States, Norway and Switzerland.\nThere are clear trends emerging from the report. While the number of incidents reported has steadily increased over the years, from 76 in 2012 to 169 in 2017, the size of the incidents has gotten smaller on average. This is due to a combination of telecom providers reporting smaller incidents and NRAs using lower breach reporting thresholds.\nUdo Helmbrecht, Director of , says: “Security breach reporting is a hallmark of EU cybersecurity legislation. Breach reporting is important for national regulators and for policy makers, because it reveals information about the actual number of security incidents, their impact, and trends.  looks forward to the adoption of the new European code for electronic communications, which broadens the scope of supervision and is necessary in the context of a fast-changing landscape of electronic communications.”\nRoot cause categories of incidents 2012-2017\nCombining data from the annual reports going back to 2012, we can see multi-annual trends. The trend graph below shows the root cause categories of incidents over the years (percentages). The ‘third party failures’ category is used as a flag on top of the other four root cause categories.\nScatter plot of incidents (duration and number of users) 2012-2017\nCombining the data from annual reports going back to 2012 (more than 700 incidents), we can see the duration (hours) and number of customers impacted. The scatter plot below shows the distribution of all years combined.\nBackground information\nSince 2010,  has been supporting the EU countries with breach reporting, developing guidelines and tools for authorities, setting workable thresholds.  is part of the\n‘Article 13a’ expert group\non security measures and incident reporting, which aims to have a harmonized implementation, a level playing field across the EU, when it comes to telecom security. This simplifies compliance and reduces overhead for EU telecom providers.\n also analyses cross-cutting issues, common root causes and trends, collaborating with NRAs and the private sector. For example, in 2018  published an\n‘EU state-of-play’ report on legacy interconnection protocols like SS7\n, an old protocol that can easily be exploited for illegal surveillance and interception. In 2016,  surveyed telecom providers across the board to map out which security measures they had put in place.\nIn 2014, \npublished recommendations for providers on how to address security requirements when dealing with ICT equipment vendors and suppliers of outsourced services for core operations\n, because issues with ICT equipment were a major cause of reported outages.\nIn 2013, when it became clear that cable cuts due to civil works were a major cause of incidents,  published\na whitepaper with good practices on how to reduce underground cable cuts\n.\nThe process of incident reporting by telecom providers and the subsequent summary reporting by telecom authorities to  started in 2011.\nMandatory breach reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package, which came into force in 2011 (Article 13a of the Framework directive, 2009/140/EC). In the following years, breach-reporting requirements were included in the EU eIDAS regulation and the EU’s NIS directive.\nCurrently, security breach reporting is mandatory for incidents causing disruptions (i.e. outages). In June, the European Parliament and Council reached an agreement on an update of the legal framework called the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC). The EECC covers not only traditional telecom providers, but also over-the-top communications services. In the EECC, breach reporting will be extended to cover not only outages, but also other security breaches like, for example, confidentiality breaches.\nElectronic communication providers in the EU have to notify significant security incidents to the national telecom regulatory authorities (NRAs) in each EU member state. Every year, the NRAs report summaries about the most significant incidents, based on a set of agreed thresholds.\nIncident reporting is key for the NRAs to understand issues and trends. The positive impact of breach reporting legislation, like Article 13a, was confirmed in\nan independent impact assessment of telecom security legislation\n.<br><strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/169-telecom-incidents-reported-extreme-weather-major-factor'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Market data is currently considered key to making informed decisions related to cybersecurity choices, on new products to be launched, policy initiatives or research and innovation funding.\nThe first report introduces a market analysis framework to be applied across various application areas over time.\nThe second report analyses the IoT cybersecurity market demand and supply in the sector of electricity distribution grids across the EU.\nHow does the framework work?\nThe framework consists of a toolbox designed to facilitate the performance of cybersecurity market analyses. It offers a range of analysis approaches based on innovative market modelling specifically adapted to the cybersecurity market.\nThis framework can be applied to various market segments. Structured around six modules, it offers the flexibility to choose the type of the performed analysis among:\nMarket structure & segmentation;\nDemand-side research;\nSupply-side research including vendor market map;\nTechnology research;\nMacro-environmental factors and\nEconomic market characteristics.\nMain points and foreseen next steps:\n- On the framework\nIdentifying the right data and the right method to perform data collection is essential if we want to avoid pitfalls such as bias. The processing techniques currently available need to be assessed and selected wisely. Moreover, the confidentiality of market data collected also raises both competition, and technical questions to be addressed. They call for the use of anonymisation, implementing security controls, etc.\nThe framework introduces a coherent taxonomy of cybersecurity products, processes and services. This cybersecurity taxonomy has been derived from relevant work already performed within the EU. Cooperation with stakeholders that are active in classifying cybersecurity has also been taken into account (e.g. European Commission’s Joint Research Centre).\nFurthermore, Member States already started implementing cybersecurity market surveillance functions. These functions aim to check whether ICT products comply with the requirements of EU cybersecurity certificates. The development of market surveillance in Member States has been identified as a priority for  today and for the years to come. The proposed cybersecurity market analysis framework may be a useful input to these efforts.\n- On IoT in distribution grids\nThe analysis on IoT for electricity grids reveals that the architecture of distribution grids is undergoing some major changes. Flexible and dynamically configured bi-directional power flows are gradually replacing traditional, one-way transmission electricity grids. The digital transformation of electricity grids will imply investing in digitalised components. However, this digitalisation will in turn lead to more cyber threat exposure by adversaries, such as State or non-State actors.\nThe report on IoT serves as a proof of concept of the initial cybersecurity market analysis framework published herewith. Part of the objective of this report was to validate the applicability of the proposed framework. With the support of the\nAd Hoc Working Group (AHWG) on the EU Cybersecurity Market\nestablished by  in 2021, the Agency will conduct additional cybersecurity market analyses to further develop the framework.\nWhat’s the legal base?\nThe\nCybersecurity Act\n(CSA) foresees the assessment of market developments, inter alia in the context of certification. Because certification is intended to improve the functioning of the internal market, performing the analysis of market trends both on the demand and on the supply sides helps ensuring market-enforcing certification efforts. Within this context, market analysis will therefore contribute to reducing the fragmentation of the EU internal market, an objective provided for by the CSA.\nTarget audience\nEU institutions, bodies and Agencies (EUIBAs);\nMember States/public authorities (e.g. Cybersecurity Authorities);\n stakeholder groups (e.g.  Advisory Group);\nFurther relevant stakeholder groups (e.g. ECCG, SCCG, NLOs)\nIndustry and industry associations (Ecosystem of Certification, EU TIC Council, vendors / manufacturers, ECSO);\nResearch institutions and research related entities and\nConsumer organisations/associations.\nFurther information\n Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework\nEU Cybersecurity Market Analysis – IoT in Distribution Grids\nContact\nFor questions related to the press and interviews, please contact\npress(at).europa.eu<br><strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cybersecurity-market-analysis-in-support-of-informed-cybersecurity-business-decisions'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 310/66 (IT) Tuesday, June 20, 2023.  In February, the online news platform Reddit experienced a security breach where attackers gained unauthorized access to internal documents, code, and some business systems.  The company announced that it was affected by the attack, which occurred on February 5, 2023. The phishing attack impacted company employees. The company clarified that Reddit user passwords and accounts were not accessed. The spear-phishing attack targeted employees by redirecting them to a fake company website. The landing page was designed to trick employees into entering their credentials and tokens. Once the employees' credentials were obtained, the attackers were able to access internal documents, code, as well as internal dashboards and some business systems. The company's main systems were not accessed.  The BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware group claimed responsibility for the February cyberattack, stating that they stole 80GB of data from Reddit.

Adversaries often target the availability of DNS and web services, however others have been targeted as well.\n Web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service.\nOne example of this type of attack is known as a simple HTTP flood, where an adversary sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server to overwhelm it and/or an application that runs on top of it. This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.\nAnother variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS. The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections. If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm. In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests.

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response.\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\nData enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\nThe data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Input Validation\nConstruct HTTP headers very carefully, avoiding the use of non-validated input data.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Input Validation\nAssume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. If an input does not strictly conform to specifications, reject it or transform it into something that conforms.\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Output Encoding\nUse and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Input Validation\nInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (\nCWE-180\n). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (\nCWE-174\n). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.\n<br><strong>Source</strong>: OWASP<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\nType 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)\n- The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\nType 0: DOM-Based XSS\n- In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nStrategy: Libraries or Frameworks\nUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.\nExamples of libraries and frameworks that make it easier to generate properly encoded output include Microsoft's Anti-XSS library, the OWASP ESAPI Encoding module, and Apache Wicket.\nPhases: Implementation; Architecture and Design\nUnderstand the context in which your data will be used and the encoding that will be expected. This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when generating outputs that can contain multiple encodings at the same time, such as web pages or multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations to determine the required encoding strategies.\nFor any data that will be output to another web page, especially any data that was received from external inputs, use the appropriate encoding on all non-alphanumeric characters.\nParts of the same output document may require different encodings, which will vary depending on whether the output is in the:\nHTML body\nElement attributes (such as src=\"XYZ\")\nURIs\nJavaScript sections\nCascading Style Sheets and style property\netc. Note that HTML Entity Encoding is only appropriate for the HTML body.\nConsult the XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet [\nREF-724\n] for more details on the types of encoding and escaping that are needed.\nPhases: Architecture and Design; Implementation\nStrategy: Attack Surface Reduction\nUnderstand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.\nEffectiveness: Limited\nNote:\nThis technique has limited effectiveness, but can be helpful when it is possible to store client state and sensitive information on the server side instead of in cookies, headers, hidden form fields, etc.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nFor any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid\nCWE-602\n. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nStrategy: Parameterization\nIf available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Output Encoding\nUse and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.\nThe problem of inconsistent output encodings often arises in web pages. If an encoding is not specified in an HTTP header, web browsers often guess about which encoding is being used. This can open up the browser to subtle XSS attacks.\nPhase: Implementation\nWith Struts, write all data from form beans with the bean's filter attribute set to true.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Attack Surface Reduction\nTo help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be HttpOnly. In browsers that support the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie. This is not a complete solution, since HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers. More importantly, XMLHTTPRequest and other powerful browser technologies provide read access to HTTP headers, including the Set-Cookie header in which the HttpOnly flag is set.\nEffectiveness: Defense in Depth\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Input Validation\nAssume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\nWhen dynamically constructing web pages, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. All input should be validated and cleansed, not just parameters that the user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected to be redisplayed by the site. It is common to see data from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer. Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended.\nNote that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing XSS, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent XSS, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, in a chat application, the heart emoticon (\"<3\") would likely pass the validation step, since it is commonly used. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the web page because it contains the \"<\" character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the \"<\" might reduce the risk of XSS, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the emoticon would not be recorded. This might seem to be a minor inconvenience, but it would be more important in a mathematical forum that wants to represent inequalities.\nEven if you make a mistake in your validation (such as forgetting one out of 100 input fields), appropriate encoding is still likely to protect you from injection-based attacks. As long as it is not done in isolation, input validation is still a useful technique, since it may significantly reduce your attack surface, allow you to detect some attacks, and provide other security benefits that proper encoding does not address.\nEnsure that you perform input validation at well-defined interfaces within the application. This will help protect the application even if a component is reused or moved elsewhere.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nStrategy: Enforcement by Conversion\nWhen the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.\nPhase: Operation\nStrategy: Firewall\nUse an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.\nEffectiveness: Moderate\nNote:\nAn application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.\nPhases: Operation; Implementation\nStrategy: Environment Hardening\nWhen using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as\nCWE-95\n,\nCWE-621\n, and similar issues.\n<br><strong>Source</strong>: OWASP<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

And yet, data protection laws and regulations seem obsolete or inadequate to address these new challenges. Therefore,  established a Working Group on Privacy & Technology to analyse the gaps and the implications for the current EU legal framework in a\nreport\n. The  Working Group offers a set of 13 key recommendations.

The implementation of this right is however not in pace with the online developments.  and the Article 29 Working Party (WP) should therefore conduct a policy analysis on how to\nre-frame the legal right of subject access,\nto give individuals maximal data access at zero cost.\nThe EU Commission should introduce a\ncomprehensive security breach notification law\n, to enable Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and individuals to better identify, understand and react to incidents.\nThe European Commission should propose a legal instrument to identity the\nBest Available Techniques\n(BATs), to ensure effective auditing and certification of data collection by Industry and DPAs.\nIdentity Management.\nEU and national\nlaw and policy makers on should re-evaluate legitimacy and proportionality grounds for processing real names and additional personal data proven by digital certificates.\nTo confront the challenge in keeping personal data of citizens within the EU jurisdiction and to provide a new tool that would enable users to manage proximity and distance with others in the digital space, both in a legal and a social sense, it is recommended that the Art. 29 WP and the EU Commission explore the notions of\nDigital Territory, property and space,\ne.g. to extend the principle o\nf legal sanctuary\nin real life\nto the digital world\nThe Agency commented on the Report:\n“The gap analysis between the existing regulations and incentives and the technological challenges of our modern society, underlines the need for original thinking, decisive actions, and to close the gaps if we are to retain and boost citizens’ trust in Information Society.”\nFor full report with all 13 recommendations:\nReport<br><strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/2008-prs/201cinside-the-matrix-privacy-data-protection-challenges201d'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Selecting Assurance Level <strong>Subsection</strong>: 6.3 Selecting xALs <strong>Content</strong>: The FAL decision tree in Figure 6-3 combines the results from the risk assessment with\nadditional considerations related to federation to allow agencies to select the most appropriate\nrequirements for their digital service offering\n\n1) What are the risks (to the organization or the subject) of providing the digital service?\nStep 1 asks agencies to look at the potential impacts of a federation failure. In other words,\nwhat would occur if an unauthorized user could compromise an assertion? Examples of\ncompromise include use of assertion replay to impersonate a valid user or leakage of assertion\ninformation through the browser. Risk should be considered from the perspective of the\norganization and to the subscriber, since one may not be negatively impacted while the other\ncould be significantly harmed. Agency risk management processes should commence with this\nstep.\n\n2) Will personal data be in the assertion?\nFAL2 is required when any personal information is passed in an assertion. Personal\ninformation release at all FALs should be considered when performing the risk assessment.\nFAL2 or higher is required when any personal information is contained in an assertion, as the\naudience and encryption requirements at FAL1 are not sufficient to protect personal\ninformation from being released. Release of even self-asserted personal information requires\nassertion protection via FAL2. Even though self-asserted information can be falsified, most\nusers will provide accurate information to benefit from the digital service. However, when\npersonal information is available to the RP via an authorized API call, such information need\nnot be included in the assertion itself. Since the assertion no longer includes personal\ninformation, it need not be encrypted and this FAL requirement does not apply.\n\n3) Are you using front chanel assertion presentation?\nRPs should use a back-channel presentation mechanism as described in SP 800-63C, Section\n7.1 where possible as such mechanisms allow for greater privacy and security. Since the\nsubscriber handles only an assertion reference and not the assertion itself, there is less chance\nof leakage of attributes or other sensitive information found in the assertion to the subscriber's\nbrowser or other programs. As the RP directly presents the assertion reference to the IdP, the\nIdP can often take steps to identify and authenticate the RP during this step. Furthermore, as\nthe RP fetches the assertion directly from the IdP over an authenticated protected channel,\nthere are fewer opportunities for an attacker to inject an assertion into an RP.\n\nAll FALs require assertions to have a baseline of protections, including signatures, expirations,\naudience restrictions, and others enumerated in SP 800-63C. When taken together, these\nmeasures make it so that assertions cannot be created or modified by an unauthorized party, and\nthat an RP will not accept an assertion created for a different system.<br><strong>Source</strong>: nist 800-63-3 </br><br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-3.pdf'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Moreover, it can provide additional highlights regarding the role of other important market players, such as regulators and research & development.\nKey findings?\nObservations made include the following:\nThe provision of services concerning cloud cybersecurity is a challenge to assess because many demand-side stakeholders are using security services from the same companies that also provide cloud services, as a kind of ‘bundled offering’. This makes it difficult to distinguish the components specifically related to cybersecurity;\nInconsistencies emerged in the perception between supply and demand. Scoring high as a threat with supply-side respondents, misconfigurations stand as potential gaps, the largest one being between perceived and managed threats. On the demand side, this gap is not as big for this specific threat, but becomes significant when it comes to insecure application programming interfaces (APIs);\nDriven by an applications appetite, secure mobile cloud computing, fog computing, edge computing and secure cloud architectures account for around 40% of the survey respondents and they emerge as the most relevant research topics in the interest of the supply and demand stakeholders alike;\nScarcity of skills emerges as the most relevant barrier for the adoption of cloud cybersecurity.\nThe Digital Single Market holds the promise of growth as it continues offering a silver lining to cloud cybersecurity regardless of the background and the business model of the providers that seek to endeavour in it.\nWhat’s new in the revamped cybersecurity market analysis framework?\nThe  Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF) guides the development of the analysis of a vertical cybersecurity market segment that comes under scrutiny.\nAlong the lines of the empirical analysis instigated by the Cloud Cybersecurity Market Analysis, the original ECSMAF has been enhanced (ECSMAF V2.0).

Digital Identity Model <strong>Subsection</strong>: 2.1 Overview <strong>Content</strong>: The SP 800-63 guidelines use digital identity models that reflect technologies and architectures that already currently available in the market. These models have a variety of entities and functions and vary in complexity. Simple models group functions, such as creating subscriber accounts and providing attributes, under a single entity. More complex models separate these functions among a larger number of entities. The entities, and their associated functions, found in digital identity models include: Subject: In these guidelines, a subject is a person and is represented by one of three roles, depending on where they are in the digital identity process. <br> - Applicant — The subject to be identity-proofed and enrolled. <br> - Subscriber — - The subject who has successfully completed the identity proofing and enrollment process or authentication (i.e., when the subject is in an active on-line session). <br> - Claimant — The subject “making a claim” to be eligible for authentication. Service provider: Service providers can perform any combination of functions involved in granting access to and delivering online services, such as a credential service provider, relyin party, verifier, and Identity provider. Credential service provider (CSP): CSP functions include identity proofing applicants to the identity service and registering authenticators to subscriber accounts. A subscriber account is the CSP’s established record of the subscriber, the subscriber’s attributes, and associated authenticators. CSP functions may be performed by an independent third party. Relying party (RP): RP functions rely on the information in the subscriber account from the CSP, typically to process a digital transaction or grant access to information or a system. When using federation, the RP accesses the information in the subscriber account through assertions from an identity provider. Verifier: The function of a verifier is to verify the claimant’s identity by verifying the claimant’s possession and control of one or more authenticators using an authentication protocol. To do this, the verifier needs to confirm the binding of the authenticators with the subscriber account and check that the subscriber account is active. Identity provider (IdP): When using federation, the IdP manages the subscriber’s primary authenticators and issues assertions derived from the subscriber account.<br><strong>Source</strong>: nist 800-63-4 </br><br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

The most important threat agent groups, namely cyber-criminals and state-sponsored actors have further advanced their motives and tactics. Monetisation motives contributed to the appearance of crypto-miners in the top 15 cyber threats.\n\nAdvances in defence have also been assessed: law enforcement authorities, governments and vendors were able to further develop active defence practices such as threat agent profiling and the combination of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and traditional intelligence. This led to a more efficient identification of attack practices and malicious artefacts, leading in turn to more efficient defence techniques and attribution rates.\n“We are witnessing the development and deployment of new technologies, which are reshaping the cyber landscape and significantly impacting society and national security. The European Union needs to be ready to adapt to and reap the benefits of these technologies to reduce the cyber-attack surface. This report raises awareness of the cyber dangers that citizens and businesses should be conscious of and responsive to. It provides recommendations as to how the digital single market can prepare an adequate response to cyber threats, with certification and standardisation at the forefront”, said ’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht.\nThe report highlights some of the main trends relating to cyber threats in 2018:\nMail and phishing messages have become the primary malware infection vector;\nCrypto-miners have become an important monetisation vector for cyber-criminals;\nState-sponsored agents increasingly target banks by using attack-vectors utilised in cyber-crime;\nThe emergence of IoT environments will remain a concern due to missing protection mechanisms in low-end IoT devices and services. The need for generic IoT protection architectures/good practices remains a pressing issue;\nCyber threat intelligence needs to respond to increasingly automated attacks through novel approaches to the use of automated tools and skills.\nSkills and training are the main focus of defenders. Public organisations struggle with staff retention due to strong competition with industry in attracting cybersecurity talents.\n addresses these conclusions by making the following recommendations:\nPolicy:\nThe EU should develop capabilities to address CTI knowledge management. EU Member States should take measures to increase their independence from currently available CTI sources (mostly from outside the EU) and to enhance the quality of CTI by adding a European context;\nEU governments and public administrations should share “baseline CTI”, covering sectorial and low-maturity needs of organisations;\nThe collection of CTI should be made easier. Coordinated efforts among EU Member States are key in the implementation of proper defence strategies.\nBusiness:\nBusinesses need to work towards making CTI available to stakeholders, focusing on the ones that lack technical knowledge;\nThe security software industry needs to research and develop solutions using automation and knowledge engineering, helping end-users and organisations mitigating most of the low-end automated cyber threats, with minimum human intervention;\nBusinesses need to take into account emerging supply chain threats and risks and bridge the gap in security knowledge among the services operated and end-users of the service.\nTechnical – research – education:\nThe ingestion of CTI knowledge needs to be enlarged to include accurate information on incidents and information from related disciplines;\nCTI knowledge management needs to be the subject of standardisation efforts, in particular: standard vocabularies, standard attack repositories, automated information collection methods, and knowledge management processes;\nResearch needs to be conducted to better understand attack practices, malware evolution, malicious infrastructure evolution and threat agent profiling.\nMore details and context can be found in the report itself:\n Threat Landscape Report 2018<br><strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/exposure-to-cyber-attacks-in-the-eu-remains-high'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

It constitutes the main instrument that allows our democracy and our EU core values such as freedom, equality, rule of law and human rights to function properly.\nThere are currently over 5 billion unique mobile subscribers and over 2000 mobile operators worldwide\n.\nIn Europe, we have 456 million unique mobile subscribers, which is equivalent to 84% of the population\n.\nMobile networks worldwide are still depending on SS7 and Diameter for controlling communications (routing voice calls and data) as well as on sets of protocols that were designed decades ago without giving adequate effect to modern day security implications. In this respect, the interconnected environment has become perilous.\nAs today’s society is becoming more and more digital, such vulnerabilities might inhibit the proper functioning of the mobile networks, thereby impacting the operation of the digital markets. A full range of new services (e.g. cloud, financial etc.) is being developed or is relying on the primary infrastructure offered by electronic communication providers (e.g. energy, transportation, eHealth etc.).\n“In this context,  has developed a study, which has examined a critical area of electronic communications: the security of interconnections in electronic communications, also known as signalling security. An EU level assessment of the current situation has been developed, so that we better understand the threat level, measures in place and possible next steps to be taken,” said Udo Helmbrecht, ’s Executive Director.\nThe most important findings of the study are:\nThe first generations of 2G/3G mobile networks rely on SS7, a protocol designed decades ago without considering security. The industry and security research community has started to look into the good practices and necessary tools that are already available. Basic security measures seem to have been implemented by more mature providers, but these measures only assure a basic level of protection. Still, more efforts are needed to be made in order to achieve an adequate level of protection across the EU.\nCurrent 4G mobile telecommunication generation uses a slightly improved signalling protocol called Diameter. Based on the same interconnect principles, the protocol was proved to be theoretically vulnerable. The industry is still trying to understand exactly what the implications are and to identify possible workarounds. It is highly probable that in the near future we will see real attacks as well as suitable solutions becoming available.\nThe new 5G mobile generation is still under development. Early releases from some manufacturers are already available, but the standards are still in their infancy. Nevertheless, there is a risk of history repeating. Given the improvements that 5G will bring – such as more subscribers, increased bandwidth etc. – having the same security risks can be extremely dangerous.\nThe report also makes several recommendations to stakeholders:\nThe EU Commission:\nConsider revising the current legal landscape in order to encompass signalling security\nConsider the adoption of baseline security requirements for electronic communications providers to include signalling security.\nNational Responsible Authorities:\nRegularly analyse the situation at national level and be aware of any developments that can trigger significant incidents in this area\nIf necessary, consider revising the national legislation, so that signalling security is covered in terms of incident reporting and adoption of minimum security requirements.\nThe industry:\nElectronic communication providers: implement the necessary measures to ensure an adequate level of security and integrity of telecommunication networks\nResponsible standardisation bodies: ensure that signalling security is properly covered within the new 5G standards.\nThe report was developed with support from ’s\nArt. 13a Expert Group\n, an informal group of EU national regulators from most of the Member States, covering security and integrity in electronic communications providers. Reaching out to EU operators has been done through them and the group members have been involved in the validation of the findings. The project is part of the overall work  is delivering periodically within the Art. 13a Expert Group. Since 2010,  has committed substantial resources and provided a lot of guidelines and other materials to support the EU electronic telecommunication area.\nThe European Commission was also involved in the study, in its capacity of policy-maker and responsible for the good implementation of the\n5G PPP\nproject.\nIn addition, the\nGSMA\nhas hugely supported the development of the project by giving us access to specific documentation and promoting the study among their stakeholders.\nThe full report can be consulted here:\nSignalling Security in Telecom SS7/Diameter/5G<br><strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/legacy-technologies-as-a-threat-to-eu2019s-telecommunications-infrastructure'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols. This may also enable follow-on behaviors such as \n or \n.\nDHCP is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol for providing network configuration settings from a DHCP server to a client and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients.\n The typical server-client interaction is as follows: \nAdversaries may spoof as a rogue DHCP server on the victim network, from which legitimate hosts may receive malicious network configurations. For example, malware can act as a DHCP server and provide adversary-owned DNS servers to the victimized computers.\n Through the malicious network configurations, an adversary may achieve the AiTM position, route client traffic through adversary-controlled systems, and collect information from the client network.\nDHCPv6 clients can receive network configuration information without being assigned an IP address by sending a \n message to the \n multicast address.\n Adversaries may use their rogue DHCP server to respond to this request message with malicious network configurations.\nRather than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spoofing to perform a DHCP exhaustion attack (i.e, \n) by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network’s DHCP allocation pool.  </br><br><strong>Source</strong>: MITRE </br><br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/003/'>Link Document</a></br>", "2022", 1]

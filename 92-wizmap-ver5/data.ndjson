Requirements by Type of Authentication, Subsection: 3.2 Out-of-band Device, Content: An out-of-band device is a device that can communicate securely with the IdP through a secondary channel, separate from the primary channel used for authentication.\n\nAn out-of-band device is a factor of authentication of the \"something you have\" type.  An out-of-band device can work in one of the following ways:\n\n(1) The user receives secret information from the out-of-band device via the secondary channel and sends that secret information to the IdP using the primary channel. For example, the user receives a 6-digit secret number sent to their mobile phone via SMS and enters that secret information on the authentication window.\n\n(2) The user receives secret information via the primary channel and uses the out-of-band device to send that secret information to the IdP using the secondary channel. For example, the user sees secret information displayed as a QR code on the authentication window and uses their mobile phone to scan the QR code, sending the secret information to the IdP.\n\nTechnical Requirements\n\n(1) The out-of-band device must create a secondary communication channel separate from the primary communication channel to receive or send secret information to the IdP.  The device used to communicate with the IdP through the primary and secondary channels may be the same device.  This device must not allow information leakage from one channel to the other without the user's permission.\n\n(2) Methods that cannot demonstrate that the user possesses and controls a specific device, such as methods using voice-over-IP (VoIP) or email, must not be considered as out-of-band device authentication methods.\n\n(3) The out-of-band device must authenticate itself to the IdP using one of the following methods:\n\n(3.1) Establish an authenticated protected channel with the IdP using cryptography. The encryption key must be stored appropriately in secure storage, such as keychain storage, trusted platform module (TPM), trusted execution environment (TEE), or secure element (SE).\n\n(3.2) Authenticate the device through the public telephone network using a SIM card or other methods that can identify the device. This method must only be used when the IdP sends secret information to the out-of-band device through the public telephone network.\n\n(4) User authentication must use one of the following methods:\n\n(4.1) Sending secret information to the IdP via the primary channel: The IdP must send randomly generated secret information to the out-of-band device. Then, the IdP must wait for a response with that secret information via the primary channel.\n\n(4.2) Sending secret information to the IdP via the secondary channel: The IdP must display randomly generated secret information to the user via the primary channel. Then, the IdP must wait for a response with that secret information from the user's out-of-band device via the secondary channel.\n\n(5) The randomly generated secret information must be at least 6 digits long.\n\n(6) The IdP must set a time limit for the user's response to the secret information to no more than 10 minutes. If the time limit is exceeded, the authentication will be considered invalid.\n\n(7) The IdP must only accept one response from the user within the specified time period to prevent replay attacks.\n\n(8) The IdP must limit the number of failed authentication attempts as specified in section 4.2.\n, Source: ETS.11 3-2566<br>URL: <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XM6aujrZQlwuxl9kQvCZ6Ud1hKG9grVv/view?usp=drive_link'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Throughout this process, it is important for the IdP and RP to know that they are talking to the same party that they were in a previous step, and ultimately to the party that they expect to be in the transaction with in the first place.Different techniques exist that provide different degrees of assurance, depending on the federation protocol in use and the needs of the system. For example, the Authorization Code Flow of [OIDC] allows the RP to register a shared secret or private key with the IdP prior to the transaction, allowing the IdP to strongly authenticate the RP’s request in the back channel to retrieve the assertion. In addition, the Proof Key for Code Exchange protocol in [RFC7636] allows the RP to dynamically create an unguessable secret that is transmitted in hashed form in the front channel and then transmitted in full in the back channel along with the assertion reference. These techniques can of course be combined for even greater assurance.Federation authorities can also facilitate the authentication process. If the RP registers its public key and identifier with the federation authority, the IdP needs only to retrieve the appropriate keys from the federation authority instead of requiring the RP to register itself ahead of time.Technical profiles of specific federation protocols are out of scope of these guidelines, but high security profiles such as [FAPI] provide extensive guidelines for implementers to deploy secure federation protocols., Source: nist 800-63c-4<br>URL: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Experts stressed a need for peer to peer information sharing mechanisms that can be easily deployed. Key is to start small and concrete and to include stakeholders organically.\nThe running  study on methodologies for identification of Critical Information Infrastructure and different implementations across Europe was discussed. Providers presented their approaches and a discussion was held on harmonization of critical infrastructure categorization and high availability requirements.\nDue to the cross border nature of infrastructure connectivity the group discussed possible approaches to incident reporting across borders.\nBig data was discussed and the providers shared their views on how to approach the increasing amount of data from a security and privacy point of view.\n's 2014 study on procurement of equipment and managed services for core operations was discussed. Providers would like to see guidelines regarding requirements on vendors and outsourcing partners when it comes to security and resilience.\nIncident reports that are submitted to  by the telecom regulators could be made accessible also to providers in an anonymous way in order to learn from experiences in dealing with incidents. Providers at the meeting thought this would be beneficial and a model could be to opt-in: If you want to share you also get access.\n will continue to build up the electronic communications reference group to get input on burning issues, test ideas and act as a bridge to national telecom regulators, the European Commission and actors in other sectors.\nFor more information about the  Electronic Communications Reference Groups:\nhttps://resilience..europa.eu/ecrg, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/security-in-telecoms-sector-in-focus-of-2nd-meeting-of-enisa2019s-electronic-comms-reference-group'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

[12.577396392822266, 1.7046254873275757, "Section: 6. Selecting Assurance Level, Subsection: 6.1 Selecting IAL, Content: The IAL decision tree in Figure 6-1 combines the results from the risk assessment with additional considerations related to identity proofing services to allow agencies to select the most appropriate identity proofing requirements for their digital service offering. The IAL selection does not mean the digital service provider will need to perform the proofing themselves. More information on whether an agency can federate is provided in Section 7.\n\n# Step 1 : To provide the service, do you need any personal information? \n- The risk assessment and IAL selection can be short circuited by answering this question first. If the service does not require any personal information to execute any digital transactions, the system can operate at IAL1.\n\n# Step 2 : To complete the transaction, do you need the information to be validated?\n- If personal information is needed, the RP needs to determine if validated and verified attributes are required, or if self-asserted attributes are acceptable. If even a single validated and verified attribute is needed, then the provider will need to accept attributes that have been IAL2 or IAL3 proofed. Again, the selection of IAL can be short circuited to IAL1 if the agency can deliver the digital service with self-asserted attributes only.\n\n# Step 3 : What are the risks (to the organization or the subject) of providing the digital service?\n- At this point, the agency understands that some level of proofing is required. Step 3 isintended to look at the potential impacts of an identity proofing failure to determine if IAL2 orIAL3 is the most appropriate selection. The primary identity proofing failure an agency mayencounter is accepting a falsified identity as true, therefore providing a service or benefit to thewrong or ineligible person. In addition, proofing, when not required, or collecting moreinformation than needed is a risk in and of itself. Hence, obtaining verified attributeinformation when not needed is also considered an identity proofing failure. This step shouldidentify if the agency answered Step 1 and 2 incorrectly, realizing they do not need personalinformation to deliver the service. Risk should be considered from the perspective of theorganization and to the user, since one may not be negatively impacted while the other couldbe significantly harmed. Agency risk management processes should commence with this step.\n\n# Step 4 : Do you need resolve an identity uniquely?\n- is intended to determine if the personal information required by the agency willultimately resolve to a unique identity. In other words, the agency needs to know the fullidentity of the subject accessing the digital service, and pseudonymous access, even with a fewvalidated and verified attributes, is not possible. If the agency needs to uniquely identify thesubject, the process can end. However, the agency should consider if Step 5 is of value tothem, as the acceptance of claims will reduce exposure to the risk of over collecting andstoring more personal information than is necessary.\n\n# Step 5 : Can you accept references? \n- focuses on whether the digital service can be provided without having access to fullattribute values. This does not mean all attributes must be delivered as claims, but this stepdoes ask the agency to look at each personal attribute they have deemed necessary, andidentify which can suffice as claims and which need to be complete values. A federatedenvironment is best suited for receiving claims, as the digital service provider is not in controlof the attribute information to start with. If the application also performs all required identityproofing, claims may not make sense since full values are already under the digital serviceprovider's control.\n\n# Step 6 : Use references if you can complete the transaction or offer the service without complete arttibute values?\n- If the agency has reached Step 6, claims should be used. This step identifies the digital serviceas an excellent candidate for accepting federated attribute references from a CSP (or multipleCSPs), since it has been determined that complete attribute values are not needed to deliver thedigital service.\n, Source: nist 800-63-3<br>URL: <a href='https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-3.pdf'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

The study focuses on identifying the current gaps and possible synergies, and provides five recommendations on how to improve cooperation.\nEurope’s society and digital economy are increasingly dependent upon cyber-space. Simultaneously, cyber-attacks on Critical Infrastructure such as energy, water and transportation systems, cyber-incidents, and cybercrime, such as botnet attacks and hacking, put the information society at risk. Moreover, most citizens - 59% - do not feel informed about cyber-crime risks.\n’s new study finds that collaboration between CERTs and LEAs is hindered by their inherent cultural differences. CERTs are typically technical, informal and focused on addressing information system issues. LEAs, by comparison, act when they suspect that a crime has been committed. The report also identifies a number of legal and regulatory barriers. Specifically, it identified a discrepancy between a bigger awareness of national laws, compared to a smaller awareness of international legal frameworks (EU directives or the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention). A number of operational factors were also identified as playing a role in hindering information exchange and collaboration. Experts who participated in the study recognised that information on roles and parameters for cooperation were the most important issues. These were followed by concerns over bureaucracy, different or unknown policies and procedures, lack of common standards, lack of clarity on what the other party will do with information and insufficient or inappropriate detail.\nThe report makes five key recommendations to overcome these barriers:\ntraining,\nimproving structures to support information sharing,\nfacilitation of collaboration,\ngood practice development and\nharmonisation and clarification of legal and regulatory aspects.\nThese recommendations cover the expansion of training between CERTs and LEAs, establishing each stakeholder’s core competencies, capabilities and procedures, good practice on writing Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and evidence sharing agreements, and further clarification for CERTs on tackling data protection issues.\nThe Executive Director of \nProfessor Udo Helmbrecht\ncommented:\n“\nComputer Emergency Response Teams and Law Enforcement Agencies cover crucial but different aspects of cyber security. Cooperation between them is vital to properly protect our digital citizens and economy. However, until now little research was done on how to connect these two areas. This study contributes to better fighting cybercrime by identifying the collaboration challenges, and ways to overcome them\n.”\nFor full\nreport\nFor background:\nCOM/2011/163\n, (\nFlash Eurobarometer Cyber-Security\n) 2012\nFor interviews:\nUlf Bergstrom, Spokesman,\npress@.europa.eu\n, +30 6948 460 143, or Jo De Muynck, Seconded National Expert, at\nopsec@.europa.eu, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/new-report-on-how-to-reinforce-cooperation-between-eu-computer-emergency-response-teams-certs-and-law-enforcement-authorities'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

On October 14, Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. issued an order to stop using AI-powered image generation applications and to exercise caution in sharing information online.  This is due to the Philippine forces' ongoing efforts to quell decades-long communist and Muslim insurgencies, and to protect its interests in the disputed South China Sea.

The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 328/66 (IT) for Monday, July 3, 2023, reported that the LockBit ransomware group claimed to have penetrated the systems of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and demanded a ransom of $70 million. TSMC is the world's largest chip manufacturer for the technology sector, including Apple and Qualcomm Inc.  On Wednesday, BleepingComputer reported that a Lockbit affiliate called Bassterlord announced the attack on TSMC via Twitter and published images containing company-related data as proof of the attack. The group claimed to have stolen a large amount of sensitive data from the company and threatened to publish it if payment was refused.  The group initially gave TSMC seven days to pay the ransom but later extended the deadline to August 6. TSMC denied being breached by Lockbit but confirmed that the group had breached Kinmax Technology, one of its IT hardware suppliers. The investigation into the incident revealed no impact on TSMC's core operations and no compromise of TSMC customer data. TSMC stated it would not work with the compromised supplier until the situation was resolved.

However, as those new technologies need to be integrated into IT infrastructures, which is already complex in nature, new challenges emerge in relation to data protection and cybersecurity. This is especially true since providing health services today implies an extended exchange of medical information and of health data among different healthcare service providers.\nHow medical data help deliver better health services\nWith a large volume of data, the healthcare sector has therefore the capacity to improve diagnosis and modelling of clinical outcomes, help assess early intervention strategies, etc. This new ecosystem improves the delivery and monitoring of health services at different levels including decision making and provides timely, appropriate and uninterrupted medical care.\nHow to ensure the safe processing of medical data\nNonetheless, the increasing processing of digitised medical data has also led to the associated risks of cyberattacks and of data breaches. To ensure adequate protection of patients’ medical data, technical solutions such as those offered by pseudonymisation can be implemented.\nThe report published today builds on the previous works of  and explores the different techniques of pseudonymisation in the context of simple use cases.\nWhat is pseudonymisation?\nPseudonymisation can significantly support personal data protection. It improves the protection of data. Pseudonymisation consists in de-associating a data subject's identity from the personal data being processed for that data subject. In practice, this is done by replacing one or more personal identifiers with what we call pseudonyms.\nDifferent techniques can be used to this effect, which are based on the way pseudonyms are generated. Such techniques include counter, random number, hash function, hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) and encryption.\nAlthough not essentially new, the process is explicitly referenced by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a technique to use to promote data protection by design and to secure the processing of personal data.\nScope of the report\nThe report explains how the techniques can be applied to improve the level of protection of personal data through simple use-cases.\nThe decision on the techniques to be used should be based on previously conducted risk-impact assessment activities such as:\nthe target\npersonal data\n(e.g. a set of identifiers);\nthe\ntechnique\nto be used;\nthe\nparameters\napplicable to the technique;\nthe\npseudonymisation\npolicy\nto be used.\nThe techniques and parameters to take into account can therefore vary according to the applicable requirements in relation to regulations, speed, simplicity, predictability and cost.\nThe scenarios chosen to explore these parameters are:\nExchanging patient’s health data;\nClinical trials;\nPatient-sourced monitoring of health data.\nPrivacy engineering in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the 10\nth\nAnnual Privacy Forum\nThe 10th Annual Privacy Forum will be taking place on 23 & 24 June 2022 in Warsaw, Poland.  organises this event together with the European Commission’s DG Connect, the Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University and the Koźmiński University.

For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system, typically gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign, in order to have the desired impact.\nOne method to achieve \n is by modifying the contents of the device clipboard. Malicious applications may monitor clipboard activity through the \n interface on Android to determine when clipboard contents have changed. Listening to clipboard activity, reading clipboard contents, and modifying clipboard contents requires no explicit application permissions and can be performed by applications running in the background. However, this behavior has changed with the release of Android 10.\nAdversaries may use \n to replace text prior to being pasted.

Canon issued a security advisory this week detailing concerns about risks to inkjet printers and sensitive information regarding Wi-Fi settings stored in the printer's memory. If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to information leaks, putting users at risk and compromising data security.  If any printer is in the hands of a third party, there is a risk of unauthorized access, which could lead to information falling into the wrong hands. Canon has compiled a list of affected printers, with 196 affected models. The company has provided mitigation measures. What to do when a user's printer is used by a third party: reset all settings, enable wireless LAN, and finally, reset the settings again. Canon also offers additional steps for models without the \"reset all settings\" function. The vendor also advises customers to consult the manual for specific reset instructions.

Although this can be classified as an injection problem, the more pertinent issue is the improper conversion of such special characters to respective context-appropriate entities before displaying them to the user.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Implementation\nCarefully check each input parameter against a rigorous positive specification (allowlist) defining the specific characters and format allowed. All input should be neutralized, not just parameters that the user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected to be redisplayed by the site. We often encounter data from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer. Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Output Encoding\nUse and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.\nThe problem of inconsistent output encodings often arises in web pages. If an encoding is not specified in an HTTP header, web browsers often guess about which encoding is being used. This can open up the browser to subtle XSS attacks.\nPhase: Implementation\nWith Struts, write all data from form beans with the bean's filter attribute set to true.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Attack Surface Reduction\nTo help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be HttpOnly. In browsers that support the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie. This is not a complete solution, since HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers. More importantly, XMLHTTPRequest and other powerful browser technologies provide read access to HTTP headers, including the Set-Cookie header in which the HttpOnly flag is set.\nEffectiveness: Defense in Depth\n, <strong>Source</strong>: OWASP<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 1]

Usability Considerations, Subsection: 9.2 Pre-Enrollment Preparation, Content: This section describes an effective approach to facilitate sufficient pre-enrollment preparation so users can avoid challenging, frustrating enrollment sessions. Ensuring users are as prepared as possible for their enrollment sessions is critical to the overall success and usability of the enrollment and identity proofing process.\n\nSuch preparation is only possible if users receive the necessary information (e.g., required documentation) in a usable format in an appropriate timeframe. This includes making users aware of exactly what identity evidence will be required. Users do not need to know anything about IALs or whether the identity evidence required is scored as “fair,” “strong,” or “superior,” whereas organizations need to know what IAL is required for access to a particular system.\n\nTo ensure users are equipped to make informed decisions about whether to proceed with the enrollment process, and what will be needed for their session, provide users:\n\n* Information about the entire process, such as what to expect in each step\n  1. Clear explanations of the expected timeframes to allow users to plan accordingly.\n* Explanation of the need for — and benefits of — identity proofing to allow users to understand the value proposition.\n* Information on the monetary amount and acceptable forms of payment, and if there is an enrollment fee. Offering a larger variety of acceptable forms of payment allows users to choose their preferred payment operation.\n* Information on whether the user’s enrollment session will be in-person or in-person over remote channels, and whether a user can choose. Only provide information relevant to the allowable session option(s).\n  1. Information on the location(s), whether a user can choose their preferred location, and necessary logistical information for in-person or in-person over remote channels session. Note that users may be reluctant to bring identity evidence to\n\ncertain public places (bank versus supermarket), as they perceive that it increases exposure to loss or theft.\n\n1. Information on the technical requirements (e.g., requirements for internet access) for remote sessions.\n   1. An option to set an appointment for in-person or in-person over remote channels identity proofing sessions to minimize wait times. If walk-ins are allowed, make it clear to users that their wait times may be greater without an appointment.\n      * Provide clear instructions for setting up an enrollment session appointment, reminders, and how to reschedule existing appointments.\n      * Offer appointment reminders and allow users to specify their preferred appointment reminder format(s) (e.g., postal mail, voicemail, email, text message). Users need information such as date, time, location, and a description of required identity evidence.\n\n* Information on the allowed and required identity evidence and attributes, whether each piece is voluntary or mandatory, and the consequences for not providing the complete set of identity evidence. Users need to know the specific combinations of identity evidence, including requirements specific to a piece of identity evidence (e.g., a raised seal on a birth certificate). This is especially important due to potential difficulties procuring the necessary identity evidence.\n  1. Where possible, implement tools to make it easier to obtain the necessary identity evidence.\n\n1. Inform users of any special requirements for minors and people with unique needs. For example, provide users with the information necessary to use trusted referees, such as a notary, legal guardian, or some other form of certified individual that can legally vouch for or act on behalf of the individual (see [Section](#page31)\n\n[5.3.4](#page31)).\n\n1. If forms are required:\n   * Provide fillable forms before and at the enrollment session. Do not require users to have access to a printer.\n\n* Minimize the amount of information users must enter on a form, as users are easily frustrated and more error-prone with longer forms.

The year’s event recorded more than 500 participants and was held in a virtual format.\nThe value of personal data in a digital environment has grown significantly over the last years as electronic products, services and processes have become more integral to everyday life. Limitations in the transparency, the functionality and interconnectivity of online and communication services increase the risk of having personal data processed without the required safeguards and level of protection.\nThe EU legal framework on privacy and data protection (the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation - GDPR\nand the\nePrivacy Directive\n) aims to better control the processing of personal data while ensuring an adequate level of protection. A key element for personal data protection is the proper use of security measures and privacy enhancing technologies as they offer practical protection mechanisms and support the application of legal provisions.\nEU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director\nJuhan Lepassaar\nsaid:\n“In today’s data-driven world, cybersecurity and data protection should be considered as complementary components impacting the entire lifecycle of electronic products, services or processes.”\nThis year’s APF opened with welcome speeches by Acting Director of Directorate CNECT H, Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity Jakub Boratyński and UCP School of Law Dean Jorge Pereira da Silva. On day one, European Data Protection Supervisor Wojciech Wiewiórowski; Deputy Chair of the European Data Protection Board Ventsislav Karadjov; and President of Portuguese Data Protection Authority Filipa Calvão presented keynote talks around the topic of ‘Crossroads of Privacy and Technology’.\nThis two-day event brought together policy-makers, data protection practitioners, researchers and industry experts to discuss the latest advancements in tracking and the practical implementation of de-identification, as well as research work in the areas of impact assessment, transparency, security and privacy by design.\nThe EU Agency for Cybersecurity has been working for several years on technical aspects in the areas of privacy and data protection.The Agency has contributed to bridging the gap between the legal framework and the available technical measures by providing an inventory of existing approaches, privacy by design strategies and technical building blocks, such as pseudonymisation and encryption. In an effort to support organisations and especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), the Agency has also proposed a risk-based approach for the adoption of security measures for the protection of personal data. Pursuant to the EU Cybersecurity Act provisions, the Agency is seeking to contribute further to the implementation of specific cybersecurity aspects, while promoting the exchange of know-how and best practices.\nBackground\nThe Annual Privacy Forum (APF) has become a renowned forum among policy-makers, researchers and industry stakeholders in the area of privacy and personal data protection who join forces to advance information security. The forum is set against the EU legislative background that is mainly, but not exclusively, comprised of the GDPR and the draft ePrivacy Regulation. The event sets the stage for new research proposals, solutions, models, applications and policies. In the last few years, the forum has also developed a deeper industry footprint to complement its original research and policy orientation. The 9th Annual Privacy Forum is scheduled to take place in June 2021 in Olso, Norway, in co-operation with University of Oslo.\nFurther Information\nEvent website:\nhttps://privacyforum.eu/\nPress Contact\nFor questions related to the press and interviews, please contact\npress (at) .europa.eu\n., <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/annual-privacy-forum-2020-policy-and-research-unite-to-advance-security-of-personal-data'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Among the advantages is the opportunity to exchange information, knowledge, expertise and good practices (25%), the opportunity to influence the decision making process (16,10%) and effective networking opportunities (17,90%). Factors impeding participation in these cooperation initiatives is because it’s uncommon in their sector of activity (35, 7%) or because these initiatives are not used in the countries in which the organisation operates (20%).\nThe EP3R participants initiated many discussions, saw a lot of commitment, and produced interesting conclusions. The scheme proved appropriate for addressing complex cooperation problems within multi-stakeholder scenarios and cooperation issues in security and resilience. It also revealed some further needs in security and resilience, and the gaps to be filled in order to reach a higher maturity level of the Telecom Sector. Key recommendations for the future include four main points:\nImplement agile PPPs which can adapt to new needs and topics;\nIncentivise Industry initiatives;\nDefine simple but formal rules and governance;\nPublish and advertise successful results\nThe EP3R (European Public-Private Partnership for Resilience) was established in 2009 and was the very first attempt at Pan-European level to use a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) to address cross-border Security and Resilience concerns in the Telecom Sector.

The report is the result of an Emerging and Future Risk assessment based on scenario building and analysis. E-health is the first scenario that has been developed and analyzed by an international group of interdisciplinary experts. In the report 14 risks have been identified. It also underlines the importance of a cautionary approach to be followed in regards to the adoption of beneficial e-health solutions: “Caution seems to be the prudent answer at this point: the benefits are clear, but also the risks entailed cannot be ignored”.\nIn our scenario Ralph is a diabetic, enrolled in a remote health monitoring and treatment programme. He goes about his daily business wearing a special vest with biosensors, keeping track of his vital signs, ensuring rapid response from doctors, while his personal data may be literally flowing around, in order to enable this kind of service. This scenario shows us that remote health schemes undoubtedly offer a great potential. Many benefits can be identified for citizens’ wellbeing and quality of life, but what are the risks entailed? It seems that e-health solutions are very important and beneficial. At the same time, they may generate serious considerations, regarding security, privacy, data protection and legal, as well as in the social, political and ethical area\nIn the course of the study, the major assets that are to be protected, e.g. health, life, human rights, etc, have been identified. Based on this, the most important risks generated regarding these assets are subsequently identified and further analysed. This is following a comprehensive risk assessment approach, as developed by  in the context of the Emerging and Future Risks Framework. In a nutshell, the report draws the attention to 14 major risks in total, among them breaches of data protection legislation, mission creep meaning secondary use of data, intrusive data surveillance and profiling by insurance companies, employers, credit-checking companies, etc, data loss or theft, system failures and service disruption.\nThe Agency commented:\n“With the development of the EFR capacity, the agency aims at early identification of risks for new application areas and/or technologies. This will help developers and policy makers understand the impacts of new application and manage the resulting risks. At the example of the analyzed e-Health scenario  underlines the risks of an overly optimistic approach to e-health, driven by the industry. While such initiatives and services are undoubtedly beneficial and worth deploying for the general good, we must at least identify and understand the various challenges posed and need to be overcome, in particular in respect to security and privacy.”\nFull report\nAnnex I: Scenario building and analysis template\nAnnex II: Risk analysis report\nFAQ, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/remote-health-monitoring-scenario'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

BugProve, a provider of IoT firmware analysis platforms, has disclosed details of more than a dozen vulnerabilities found in security cameras made by Zavio, a Chinese company that has since shut down. However, the cameras are reportedly still in use in the United States and Europe.\n\nBecause Zavio is defunct, BugProve worked with CCTV Camera Pros, a major Zavio camera distributor in the US, to investigate the vulnerabilities and report them to the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) for public disclosure and CVE assignment. According to the companies, seven of the vulnerabilities can be exploited for unauthenticated remote code execution with root privileges. These flaws allow attackers to completely take over the targeted devices. IP cameras are often targeted by botnet herders and used in DDoS and other attacks. CISA has assigned only two CVE identifiers, CVE-2023-4249 and CVE-2023-3959, as the vulnerabilities stem from the same root cause.\n\nSince the affected Zavio cameras will not receive patches, users are advised to replace the devices in order to prevent becoming victims of malicious attacks.

The Canadian government has ordered TikTok, owned by ByteDance in China, to cease operations in the country.  The decision is stated to be the result of a national security risk assessment.  The review was conducted by Canada’s security and intelligence community. The government emphasized that it will not restrict access to TikTok for the general Canadian public, but advised citizens to assess the potential risks of using the social media app.  François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, stated that the government wants citizens to be aware of the risks of using social media platforms, particularly in terms of data management and security related to foreign countries. TikTok has been banned on government devices since February 2023.  TikTok responded that closing the office in Canada will result in hundreds of employees being laid off.  The company intends to challenge this order in court.  In a statement, ByteDance confirmed that no user data will be shared with the Chinese government. However, concerns remain that TikTok may be forced to hand over user data. This has resulted in the U.S. enacting a law requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok by January 2025 or face a ban in the country. Currently, TikTok is completely banned in several countries, including Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, and is prohibited on government-issued devices in many countries around the world. , <strong>Source</strong>: Thai-CERT<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/11/08/%e0%b9%81%e0%b8%84%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%94%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%aa%e0%b8%b1%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%87-tiktok-%e0%b8%9b%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%94%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%94%e0%b8%b3%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%b4/'>Link Document</a></br>", "2024", 1]

The paper gives the first overview of the vast disparity between privacy features in eID cards across Europe. eID cards are currently used mainly for tax declarations and other e-government services, but applications are branching out into the commercial sector. At the same time, Europe lacks a coordinated strategy for how to protect the private data stored by the card, which is both an obstacle to eID interoperability and limits its acceptance by the users. This analysis sets the stage for a privacy baseline in European eID cards.\n\nToday, ten national eID card schemes are already in use across the EU and thirteen more are in the pipeline. Presently, eID cards are used primarily by e-government services, eg, for taxation, but there are also commercial applications of eID cards. Many more eservices are planned in the near future, using the data on the card for anything from secure chat to library access and piggybacking on the infrastructure investments which have been made. In all these applications, the eID card is a gateway to personal information, be it at national or European level. At the same time, it is key to address privacy concerns related to eID: unwanted disclosure of data and subsequent misuse.\nThe  Position Paper points out that privacy features have been developed, implemented and tested at a national level only. There is no co-ordinated strategy at European level addressing which [and how] features should be implemented and this is an important obstacle for cross border eID interoperability. This is a major hurdle for the acceptance of eID cards and their usage in day-to-day applications. ’s Position Paper provides the first comprehensive overview of the state of play in Europe - an essential step towards improving the base-line of citizen privacy and protection in eID cards across Europe.\nThe paper charts how available privacy-enhancing technologies are implemented in existing and planned European eID card specifications. The paper analyses in detail eleven risks to personal privacy resulting from the use of national electronic identity card schemes. It also lists eight practicable techniques available to address and mitigate these risks. Furthermore, through eight comparison charts, the Position Paper maps out the situation of available privacy features in existing cards. With numerous references to national specifications, it is a good starting point for identifying best practices and a source of reference for future choices to be made by European policy makers.\nThe Agency commented:\n“Privacy is an area where the member states' approaches differ a lot and European eID will not take off unless we get this right. Europe needs to reflect on eID privacy and its role in the interoperability puzzle. The fundamental human right to privacy must be guaranteed for all European eID card holders. Therefore,  will continue to work in this field in 2009.”\nFull position paper, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/privacy-and-eid'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Researchers from Patchstack have warned of a serious vulnerability in the LiteSpeed Cache plugin for WordPress, which is used by more than 5 million websites.  The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-44000, has a CVSS score of 7.5 and could allow unauthenticated attackers to take control of user accounts and escalate privileges to administrator. The flaw is caused by a cookie leak in WordPress debug log files, which allows attackers to use this information to log into the website with a valid user session. However, this vulnerability only occurs when the debug feature is enabled, which is disabled by default in WordPress.  For mitigation, users should update the LiteSpeed Cache plugin to version 6.5.0.1, which addresses this issue.  Additionally, old log files that may contain leaked cookie information should be deleted. Direct access to log files should also be prevented.  Updating and patching vulnerabilities is crucial for ensuring secure WordPress usage. , <strong>Source</strong>: Thai-CERT<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/09/10/%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%95%e0%b8%b7%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%9c%e0%b8%b9%e0%b9%89%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%89-wordpress-%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%87%e0%b9%82%e0%b8%ab%e0%b8%a7%e0%b9%88%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%99/'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 1]

This highlights the difficulty of defending against insider threats as well as the irreversibility of information leakage.\n•\nThe second incident was\nthe\ninterruption of domain name and cloud services for the Wikileaks website\n. Although ostensibly due to terms of service violations, this highlights the vulnerability of globally distributed IT services to regional differences in policy, regulation, the interpretation of rights and the neutrality of service providers in the face of political pressure (see also risks R21 and R22 in\n's cloud computing risk assessment\n).\n• The third incident was\nthe hacktivist attacks both against, and in support of Wikileaks\n. A hacker called Jester mounted a denial of service (DoS) attack against the Wikileaks website. Later, in support of Wikileaks, the group Anonymous distributed the \"Low Orbit Ion Cannon\" (LOIC) tool to mount distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against several high profile services including Visa, Paypal and governmental sites (1). These incidents highlight the following issues:\nSize doesn't matter: the number of computers used in the attacks was relatively small (in the 100’s). Some press reports claim over six times the real number, which is indicative of the unreliability of information about botnets.  is currently preparing a comprehensive report on \"Botnets: Detection, Measurement, Disinfection & Defence\" to be published in January 2011 which addresses this issue.\nThe robustness of some services in the face of these attacks has demonstrated the resilience of cloud architectures against DoS attacks (as discussed in\n's cloud computing risk assessment\n).\nThe LOIC tool (in Hivemind mode (2)) allows a third party to execute commands remotely. We note that apart from the potential legal implications, users thus cede control over their computer to a potentially untrusted third party.\nThe denial of service attacks highlight the importance of the Commission's 2010 enhancements to the\nEU cybercrime directive\n, in enabling an efficient and effective reaction to cyber security incidents.\nProf. Helmbrecht notes: “\nThe freedom the internet allows in moving between jurisdictions and technologies makes cyber security an asymmetric challenge. But our economy and our governments are heavily reliant on functioning and resilient systems. Therefore it is a challenge which must be met through global co-operation to strengthen all aspects of cyber security\n.”\n1) Strictly speaking the computers running LOIC do not constitute a botnet since LOIC is installed with the consent of the user. However, LOIC does share features with botnet software, in particular the ability to respond to centrally issued commands.\n2) The Hive Mind option is responsible for connecting to servers used for attack coordination.\nStay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both  news items & press releases!\nNews items;\nhttp://www..europa.eu/media/news-items/news-wires/RSS\nPRs:\nhttp://www..europa.eu/media/press-releases/press-releases/RSS, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-statement-on-wikileaks-events'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Implementation Requirements, Content: Many syncable authenticators are built upon W3C’s [WebAuthn] specification, which provides a common data structure, a challenge-response cryptographic protocol, and an API for leveraging public-key credentials. The specification is flexible and adaptive, meaning that not all deployments of WebAuthn credentials will meet the requirements of federal agencies for implementation.The specification has a series of flags that the RP application can request from the authenticator to provide additional context for the authentication event and determine whether it meets the RP’s access policies. This section describes certain flags in the WebAuthn specification that federal agencies acting as RPs should understand and interrogate when building their syncable authenticator implementations to align with NIST AAL2 guidelines.The following requirements apply to WebAuthn Level 3 flags:In addition to the flags specified above, agencies may wish to gain additional information on the origins and capabilities of the syncable authenticators that they choose to implement and accept. Within the context of FIDO2 WebAuthn, some authenticators support attestation features that can be used to determine the capabilities and manufacturers of specific authenticators. For enterprise use cases, agencies SHOULD implement attestation capabilities based on the functionality offered by their platform providers. This would take the form of an enterprise attestation in which the RP requests identifying information about the authenticator.Attestations SHOULD NOT block the use of syncable authenticators for broad public-facing applications. Due to their limited availability in consumer products, requiring their use is likely to divert users to less secure authentication options that are vulnerable to phishing (e.g., PSTN-based out-of-band authentication). While authentication transaction metadata, such as the User Verified flag indicating the use of a local activation factor, is available in WebAuthn responses, attestation can provide stronger assurance of the characteristics of the authenticator used in a transaction.  RPs MAY use attestation to determine the level of confidence they have in a syncable authenticator.Even if the RP requests flag and attestation data, the authenticator may not return all of the requested information, or it may return information that is inconsistent with the expected response mandated for access to a resource. Agencies SHALL evaluate the use cases for syncable authenticators and determine the appropriate access policy decisions that they intend to make based on the returned information., Source: nist 800-63b-4<br>URL: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

In prior versions of SP 800-63, protocols resistant to verifier-impersonation attacks were also referred to as “strongly MitM resistant.”\nA verifier impersonation-resistant authentication protocol SHALL establish an authenticated protected channel with the verifier. It SHALL then strongly and irreversibly bind a channel identifier that was negotiated in establishing the authenticated protected channel to the authenticator output (e.g., by signing the two values together using a private key controlled by the claimant for which the public key is known to the verifier). The verifier SHALL validate the signature or other information used to prove verifier impersonation resistance.

In 2023 alone, over 200 reported cyber incidents targeted the energy sector and more than half of them were directed specifically at Europe. The significant role the sector holds for the European economy renders the energy industry particularly susceptible to cyber threats and attacks.\nEU Commissioner for the\nInternal Market,\nThierry Breton\nvisited  premises and the Cyber Europe Exercise room to have a glimpse of how the exercise puts the EU energy infrastructure to the test. He stated: “Cybersecurity is a common priority. In 2023 alone, more than 200 reported cyber incidents targeted the energy sector, and more than half of them were directed specifically against Europe. Cybersecurity threats in critical sectors can have an impact on the everyday life of citizens, but also on businesses and public services throughout the EU. This type of exercise is essential to test our cybersecurity resilience with all key partners if we are to protect EU citizens.”\nThe Executive Director of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity,\nJuhan Lepassaar\n, stated: ‘The preservation of our critical infrastructure is one of the building blocks of the single market and thus, we have to advance our preparedness and response capacities to protect it. The Cyber Europe exercise is the evidence that we are committed in our efforts to achieve that.’\nThe Network and Information Security (NIS) Investments in the EU report by  found that 32% of operators in the energy sector do not have a single critical Operation Technology (OT) process monitored by a Security Operations Center (SOC). Operational Technology and Information Technology are covered by a single SOC for 52% of operators of essential services in the energy sector.\nGiven the importance of the energy sector, this year’s Cyber Europe exercise focused on a scenario that involved cyber threats aiming at the EU energy infrastructure deriving from friction caused by geopolitical tension between the European Union and a fictious foreign nation.\nWith propaganda swaying public opinion and concerns about APTs (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups exploiting vulnerabilities, the energy sector became a prime target. To prevent a large-scale attack crippling the European economy and destabilising political balance, stakeholders had to swiftly coordinate their actions and response.\nThe two-day event simulated a series of large-scale cyber incidents. Working together, players honed their coordination and crisis management skills to tackle the challenges posed by the advanced scenarios and ensure business continuity in the face of a crisis.\nThe pan-European exercise brought together 30 national cybersecurity agencies, a number of EU agencies, bodies and networks and over 1000 experts dealing with a range of areas from incident response to decision-making. It is one of the largest cyber exercises organised in Europe and it is powered by , which celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2024.\nFollowing the biennial exercise, an analysis on the processes and outcomes will be conducted to gain insights on the weaknesses identified. These findings will be included in the after-action report, which intends to provide guidance and suggestions for further improvement both for the exercise itself but also for strengthening the resilience of the EU energy sector.\nFurther Information\nCyber Europe —  (europa.eu)\nCyber Europe 2024 —  (europa.eu)\nEnergy sector —  (europa.eu)\nEU CyCLONe —  (europa.eu)\nContact\nFor press questions and interviews, please contact\npress (at) .europa.eu, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/cyber-europe-tests-the-eu-cyber-preparedness-in-the-energy-sector'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Security properties like confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation rely on strong cryptographic mechanisms, especially in an always connected, always online world.\nIn addition, cryptography’s applications open up new opportunities and markets: digital signatures or online transactions would not be possible without it. Given its importance, cryptography (encryption) remains a heavily researched field, and even finds its way into the headlines, referred to in high level documents and even legislation.\nOne such document is the new\nEU Cybersecurity Strategy\n(December 2020), which mentions out quantum computing and encryption as key technologies for achieving resilience, technological sovereignty and leadership.\nWith the objective to support the implementation of the Cybersecurity Strategy and of relevant legislative efforts,  publishes two reports on the topic of cryptography. The first one focuses on the forthcoming disruptions of post-quantum computing on our present cybersecurity infrastructure and how we need to mitigate it. The second one introduces the cryptographic building blocks used in a majority of digital currencies & crypto-assets, which will fall under the scope of a new EU regulatory proposal.\nPost Quantum security and why it matters\nQuantum technology will enable a huge leap forward in many branches of industry, as it can efficiently resolve problems technologies of today are not able to provide a solution for. However, this technology will be highly disruptive for our current security equipment and systems.\nAs a matter of fact, scientists commonly agree that quantum computers will be able to break widely used public-key cryptographic schemes. These are the same schemes working behind the green lock in our browser tabs telling us that our data are protected against malicious eavesdroppers. Similarly, these are also the same schemes allowing us to have digital signatures and designed to implement the Electronic identification (eID) and Trust Services of the eIDAs regulation. Consequently, data or processes protected by those schemes, such as bank transactions, software updates, digitally signed official documents, patient records and more, will instantly cease to be secure.\nThis initiative is motivated by the fact that the transition to new quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms will take years, since the related processes are both extremely intricate and financially costly.\nThe study -\nPost-Quantum Cryptography: Current state and quantum mitigation\n- provides a concise overview of the current progress of the standardisation process of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes. It introduces a framework to analyse existing quantum-safe solutions, classifying them into families and discussing their advantages and shortcomings.\nWith contributions from top experts in the field, it helps readers navigate an overly complex but also fascinating topic for the future of cybersecurity. The study aims to help decision makers and system designers take up appropriate actions, as soon as possible. To that end, it includes useful quantum resistant techniques that can be implemented in today’s systems until PQC algorithms become standardised and generally available.\nUnder the hood of crypto assets & the Distributed Ledger Technology\nWith the creation of a pan-European blockchain regulatory sandbox, the European Union intends to put Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) to the test. Such technologies, also referred to as blockchain technologies, are those on which digital assets such as cryptocurrencies are built upon. But the applications do not stop there, smart contracts, anti-counterfeit seals, even games, have been based on a few important cryptographic building blocks.\nThe  report -\nCrypto Assets: Introduction to Digital Currencies and Distributed Ledger Technologies\n- aims to further increase understanding around these underlying cryptographic components that compose the blockchain and in extension crypto-assets, digital currencies and the host of applications possible.\nAs a continuation of an earlier report on the security and challenges of DLTs, this report provides an in-depth explanation of the technical components involved and illustrates their uses into popular deployed instances.\nBy focusing on crypto-assets,  intends to support policymakers by explaining the underling cryptographic mechanics used and raise awareness on foreseen security, financial, legal and data protection issues.\nBackground\nThis work falls under the provisions of Articles 5, 8, 9 and 11 of the\nCybersecurity Act\n. 's Work Programme foresees activities to support Knowledge Building in Cryptographic algorithms.\nIn cooperation with the European Commission, Member States and other EU bodies, the Agency engages with expert groups to address emerging challenges and promote good practices.\nOne of these emerging risks arise in relation to quantum computing cryptanalytics capabilities, where there is need to transition to quantum safe encryption as a counter measure and to support EU in advancing its strategic digital autonomy. In addition, the continuation of past  work on blockchain security with a new study looking at the cryptographic components was very timely as it coincided with the EU efforts in regulating crypto-assets and the announcement of the ECB that it is exploring the plausibility of a centrally backed digital euro, to complement the euro banknote.\nFurther information\n report -\nPost-Quantum Cryptography: Current state and quantum mitigation\n report -\nCrypto Assets: Introduction to Digital Currencies and Distributed Ledger Technologies\nOn the security of personal data:\nCryptographic Protocols and Tools\nEU Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade\nDistributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity - Improving information security in the financial sector\nContacts\nFor questions related to the press and interviews, please contact\npress (at) .europa.eu, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/solving-the-cryptography-riddle-post-quantum-computing-crypto-assets-blockchain-puzzles'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nStrategy: Libraries or Frameworks\nWhen there is a need to store or transmit sensitive data, use strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to encrypt that data. Select a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and use well-tested implementations. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be available for analysis.\nFor example, US government systems require FIPS 140-2 certification [\nREF-1192\n].\nDo not develop custom or private cryptographic algorithms. They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If the algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how it works, then it is especially weak.\nPeriodically ensure that the cryptography has not become obsolete. Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days or hours. This includes MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, and other algorithms that were once regarded as strong. [\nREF-267\n]\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nEnsure that the design allows one cryptographic algorithm to be replaced with another in the next generation or version. Where possible, use wrappers to make the interfaces uniform. This will make it easier to upgrade to stronger algorithms. With hardware, design the product at the Intellectual Property (IP) level so that one cryptographic algorithm can be replaced with another in the next generation of the hardware product.\nEffectiveness: Defense in Depth\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nCarefully manage and protect cryptographic keys (see\nCWE-320\n). If the keys can be guessed or stolen, then the strength of the cryptography itself is irrelevant.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nStrategy: Libraries or Frameworks\nUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.\nIndustry-standard implementations will save development time and may be more likely to avoid errors that can occur during implementation of cryptographic algorithms. Consider the ESAPI Encryption feature.\nPhases: Implementation; Architecture and Design\nWhen using industry-approved techniques, use them correctly. Don't cut corners by skipping resource-intensive steps (\nCWE-325\n). These steps are often essential for preventing common attacks.\n, <strong>Source</strong>: OWASP<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 1]

The paper analyses the anatomy of ‘Online Shopping’, and warns on the risks and threats. It provides different countermeasures and guidelines to consumers in the form of 5 ‘golden rules’ on how to shop safely online. The paper also provides a comprehensive checklist for the online seller on how to operate secure online business. As many citizens lack trust in online purchases, this report increases awareness of the real risks and how to tackle them.\n\nNearly 40% of EU citizens shopped on-line in 2009, according to EUROSTAT’s Internet in 2009 survey. The\npaper\nconcludes that online shopping will continue to be an increasing global trend. Yet, the biggest barrier is the fear of potential fraud or identity theft. This fear still keeps millions of consumers from buying goods or services online. This survey shows that ca 1/3 of those not having used the Internet for e-commerce had concerns about payment security. Another 30 % had privacy and trust concerns. As ‘Trust and security’ is one of the six major themes of the Digital Agenda for Europe, this fear underlines the last barrier for a bigger online economy.\nThe paper gives a comprehensive overview of the definition, history, the main drivers and trends in online shopping. It also looks into e.g. banks payment services, the underlying Internet Infrastructure Services and online/fee fraud.\nThe\n5 ‘golden rules’ for consumers\ncover the following points:\n1. Tips on avoiding fraudulent sites\n2. How to protect your data when shopping online\n3. Tips for safe transactions when paying online\n4. Overview of legislation that protects online customers\n5. How to deal with completion of the sale issues\nThe paper concludes that online shopping offers great benefits for the consumers to enjoy. Sellers also reach customers that they would otherwise never reach. Online shopping can also provide organisational benefits such as improved processes, better brand recognition, reduced costs and improved productivity. However, the Internet also brings new risks, as criminals will make use of the new possibilities to steal, defraud and commit online crimes.\nThe Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht comments; “This comprehensive white paper on online shopping and its 5 ‘golden rules’ is a milestone for increasing trust in the digital economy, and making it prosper even more.”\nClick for the\nfull report\nand all countermeasures.\nFor interviews please contact:\nUlf Bergström, Spokesman, , Mobile: +30 6948 460134,\npress@.europa.eu\n,\nKaterina Christaki, Digital Communications, katerina.christaki[at].europa.eu\nStay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both  news items & press releases!\nNews items;\nhttp://www..europa.eu/media/news-items/news-wires/RSS\nPRs:\nhttp://www..europa.eu/media/press-releases/press-releases/RSS, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/the-anatomy-of-online-shopping-dissected-new-eu-agency-white-paper'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Software Attestations, Content: Software and device attestation can be used to augment the establishment of cryptographic keys and identifiers, especially in dynamic and distributed systems. Attestations in this usage are cryptographically-bound statements that a particular piece of software, device, or runtime system meets a set of agreed-upon parameters. The attestation is presented by the software in the context of establishing its identity, and allows the receiver to verify the request with a higher degree of certainty than they would otherwise.For example, a specific distribution of subscriber-controlled wallet software can be signed by its distributor, allowing RPs to recognize individual instances of that software. Alternatively, an RP could be issued an attestation from a federation authority, allowing IdPs to recognize the RP as part of the federation.When attestations are required by the trust agreement or requested as part of the federation protocol, received attestations SHALL be validated by the receiver.See [RFC7591] Sec. 2.3 for more information about software statements, which are a means for OAuth and OpenID Connect RPs to communicate a signed set of software attributes during dynamic client registration., Source: nist 800-63c-4<br>URL: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Yet, some financial institutions are still not considering the risk of inadequate authentication mechanisms according to a new study by the EU Agency .\n\nThe report analyses current e-Finance fraud and correlates it with the financial institutions’ customers’ authentication mechanisms. The report emphasises the need for updated security mechanisms and provides 10 recommended approaches.\nThe Agency analysed more than 100 replies to a survey distributed to merchants and e-banking security professionals on the electronic IDentity and Authentication Systems (eIDAS) used by citizens and customers in e-Finance and e-Payment systems. Additionally, the Agency identified the risk and the attack patterns concerning each authentication mechanism, including phishing, ID-theft, session and identity hi-jacking, etc., of the financial institutions, merchants and payment service providers.\nAs a result, the Agency produced guidelines, best practices and recommendations for e-banking and Internet payments. Key recommendations are\nImprove the security of the e-Finance environment\n, meaning that financial actors must:\nMake risk analysis based on customers’ profile and size of the institution,\nImprove customers’ awareness and skills,\nImplement authentication methods tailored to the customer behaviour profiles and transactions parameters (e.g. destination country, amount)\nEarly detection of customers’ device compromise through device registration, testing and evaluation of its security. (”\nAssume all devices are infected\n”)\nImprove the security of e-Finance applications and their distribution channels to customers\n: encouraging the traditional “security by design”, taking into account the proposed new\npersonal data protection Directive\n, and using trusted channels to install applications in the customers’ device.\nPromote proportionality between selected method(s) robustness and the identified risk\n(adequacy of eIDAS to transaction context). with emphasis on the use of 2 factor authentication (e.g ATMs: a card and a PIN code) even for low risk operations.\nImprove knowledge and the behaviour of customers and professionals\n:\nTo summarise, today current eIDAS practices in the financial sector do not cover many risks. The ECB and European Commission are developing recommendations and regulations aligned with the  report to identify and set up tools to reduce losses due to fraud.\nThe\nExecutive Director\nof , Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented: “\nThe financial sector manages e-transactions of hundreds of billions of euro every year. Therefore, secure e-identities and authentication is simply a must for the economy. The financial institutions should use security as a competitive marketing tool.

It evaluates the campaign of last year and provides insights for future years.\n\nOver two thirds of Member States who responded (69%) rated the overall implementation of the ECSM 2021 campaign as Good or Excellent, while 73% of them say that their campaign has been effective in improving how an individual would act, if they are faced with a cybersecurity threat. At the same time 77% agree that their campaign (or their partners') has changed the attitudes of organisations towards cyber threats.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed the scope of last year’s European Cybersecurity Month (ECSM).The aim of the 2021 European Cybersecurity Month Campaign was to go beyond informing and to encourage action and behaviour change with the ultimate aim of preventing cyber incidents.\nThe European Union Agency for Cybersecurity () is called to respond to the same challenge for the 2022 European Cybersecurity Month (scheduled to take place in October 2022) and the 2021 ECSM Deployment report is to be used as a blueprint, providing useful insights towards reaching its target of fewer cyber incidents.\nHighlights of the 2021 ECSM Deployment report\nThe report summarises the activities carried out by the agency and by participating EU Bodies, Member States, EEA countries and partners for the 2021 campaign. It provides an analysis of what worked well and presents the evaluation of the campaign, as well as insights that can be drawn for future years.\nThe report further highlights ’s previous year’s success with the high impact of the ‘Think Before U Click’ campaign, which continued to have a resounding success this year as well, with a significant growth in social media mentions. A social media reach of over 20 million was achieved in 2021 which is more than double of the reach that was achieved in 2020 (8.8 million) and in previous years. Social media mentions increased to over 23,000 which is a triple increase compared to 2020 and Twitter followers increased to over 28,000 from 24,000.\nBuilding therefore on the analysis of what worked well in the 2020 campaign, the report concludes that more digital tools such as video, generated greater engagement. A series of real-life stories were accompanied with actionable recommendations. Infographics were created and distributed through social media. Gamified content such as social media puzzles were included to engage people in innovative ways. Rather than just focusing on prevention as in the past years,  provided useful tips on how to manage situations through\nan EU Interactive map\nwith contact details which enable users to call a helpline or get help where possible when they fall victims of cyberattacks.\nLooking ahead- 2022 ECSM\nThis year will be the 10\nth\nedition of the ESCM and the focus will be on different topics and cybersecurity themes, as compared to previous years. The focus will be on\nRansomware\nand\nPhishing\nwhich are two main trends observed currently in the cyber threat landscape. The themes of each year’s campaign are decided at the beginning of the year during a dedicated planning session taking place between  and partners from the EU Member States and EU Institutions.\nDuring the 2022 ECSM an\nEU awards\ncompetition will also take place for the first time as a pilot activity during which the best material from Member States will be selected (i.e best video, best infographic, best educational toolkit) and will be translated into the 24 EU official languages. The winning material will also be used as part of the ECSM 2022 campaign material.\n10 years anniversary of the ECSM\nThe 2022 European Cybersecurity Month (ECSM) coincides with its 10-year anniversary, since first launched in 2012. The campaign is now part of the actions designed to implement the provisions of the EU Cybersecurity Act on awareness raising and education, since the idea was explored in a feasibility study in 2011 and launched as a pilot project in 2012.\nThe ECSM provides further one of the areas in which  assists Member States in their efforts to raise cybersecurity awareness and promote cybersecurity education across the Union.\nAimed at citizens, organisations and businesses, (ECSM) is a month-long campaign to be held for many Octobers to come, across the EU and beyond.\nTarget audience of the report\nThis report is intended for the following stakeholders:\nOrganisations that have supported the ECSM – or intend to in the future.\nCybersecurity professionals and other groups who have participated in the ECSM.\nEU and national policymakers aiming to improve the cybersecurity awareness of citizens and            professionals.\nAbout the European Cybersecurity Month (ECSM)\nThe European Cybersecurity Month (ECSM) is the European Union’s annual campaign dedicated to promoting cybersecurity among citizens and organisations, and to providing up-to-date digital security information through awareness raising and the sharing of good practices. Each year, for the entire month of October, hundreds of activities take place across Europe, including conferences, workshops, trainings, webinars, presentations, online quizzes and more, to provide resources for citizens to learn more about protecting themselves online.\nThe ECSM is coordinated by  and supported by the European Commission, Europol, the European Central Bank and EU Member States, EEA countries, and more than 300 partners (governments, universities, think tanks, NGOs, professional associations, private sector businesses) from Europe, and beyond.\nGet involved online\nFollow the ECSM campaign on Twitter\n@CyberSecMonth\nwith hashtags\n#CyberSecMonth\nand #ThinkB4Uclick, and on Facebook\n@CyberSecMonthEU\n.\nMore information on the ECSM can be found at\ncybersecuritymonth.eu\n.\nDeployment report of the European Cybersecurity Month (ECSM) for 2021:\nEuropean Cybersecurity Month 2021 - Deployment report\nEU Interactive map\nMain ECSM 2021 highlights\nContact\nFor questions related to the press and interviews, please contact\npress(at).europa.eu, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cybersecurity-month-campaign-reduces-cyber-incidents'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

The Port of Seattle confirmed last Friday that the Rhysida Ransomware group was responsible for the cyberattack that occurred in August.  The incident affected the agency's website and phone systems, including Sea-Tac Airport, causing temporary disruptions to travel and various services. The port isolated critical systems to prevent further damage.  Media reports indicated that the cyberattack affected the port's email, website, and phone systems and impacted baggage handling and flights at Sea-Tac Airport. Alaska Airlines employees had to manually process over 7,000 bags due to check-in system failures. Lance Lyttle, Managing Director of Aviation at Sea-Tac Airport, believed the incident was a cyberattack.  The Port of Seattle confirmed Rhysida Ransomware as the perpetrator. This group has previously attacked organizations in various industries, including education, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and government.  The port revealed that hackers gained access to the system and encrypted parts of the computer system. The port refused to pay the ransom to the Rhysida Ransomware group and collaborated with external experts and government agencies to investigate the incident.  Furthermore, the port is implementing enhanced security measures for its IT infrastructure, including strengthening identity management and authentication systems to prevent future incidents. , <strong>Source</strong>: Thai-CERT<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/09/17/%e0%b8%97%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%b2%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%b7%e0%b8%ad-seattle-%e0%b9%84%e0%b8%94%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%b7%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%a7%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%a5/'>Link Document</a></br>", "2024", 1]

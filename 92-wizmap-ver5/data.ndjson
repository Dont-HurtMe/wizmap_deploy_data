Usability Considerations, <strong>Subsection</strong>: 9.1 General User Experience Considerations During Enrollment and Identity Proofing, <strong>Content</strong>: This sub-section provides usability considerations that are applicable across all steps of the enrollment process. Usability considerations specific to each step are detailed in Sections [9.2](#page40) to [9.4.](https://www.section508.gov/content/learn/laws-and-policies)\n\n* To avoid user frustration, streamline the process required for enrollment to make each step as clear and easy as possible.\n* Clearly communicate how and where to acquire technical assistance. For example, provide helpful information such as a link to online self-service feature, chat sessions, and a phone number for help desk support. Ideally, sufficient information should be provided to enable users to answer their own enrollment preparation questions without outside intervention.\n* Clearly explain who is collecting their data and why. Also indicate the path their data will take, in particular where the data is being stored.\n* Ensure all information presented is usable.\n\n1. Follow good information design practice for all user-facing materials (e.g., data collection notices and fillable forms).\n2. Write materials in plain language, typically at a 6th to 8th grade literacy level, and avoid technical jargon. Use active voice and conversational style, logically sequence\n\nmain points, use the same word consistently rather than synonyms to avoid confusion, and use bullets, numbers, and formatting where appropriate to aid readability.\n\n1. Consider text legibility, such as font style, size, color, and contrast with surrounding background. The highest contrast is black on white. Text legibility is important because users have different levels of visual acuity. Illegible text will contribute to user comprehension errors or user entry errors (e.g., when completing fillable forms).\n   1. Use sans serif font styles for electronic materials and serif fonts for paper materials. o When possible, avoid fonts that do not clearly distinguish between easily confusable\n\ncharacters (such as the letter “O” and the number “0”). This is especially important for enrollment codes.\n\no Use a minimum font size of 12 points, as long as the text fits the display.\n\n* Perform a usability evaluation for each step with representative users. Establish realistic goals and tasks, and appropriate contexts of use for the usability evaluation., <strong>Source</strong>: nist 800-63a-3<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63a.pdf'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Usability Considerations, <strong>Content</strong>: This section is informative.<br>In order to align with the standard terminology of user-centered design and usability, the term “user” is used throughout this section to refer to the human party. In most cases, the user in question will be the subject (in the role of applicant, claimant, or subscriber) as described elsewhere in these guidelines.<br>This section is intended to raise implementers’ awareness of the usability considerations associated with identity proofing and enrollment (for usability considerations for typical authenticator usage and intermittent events, see Sec. 8 of [SP800-63B].<br>[ISO/IEC9241-11] defines usability as the “extent to which a system, product, or service can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.” This definition focuses on users, goals, and context of use as the necessary elements for achieving effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. A holistic approach considering these key elements is necessary to achieve usability.<br>The overarching goal of usability for identity proofing and enrollment is to promote a smooth, positive enrollment process for users by minimizing user burden (e.g., time and frustration) and enrollment friction (e.g., the number of steps to complete and the amount of information to track). To achieve this goal, organizations have to first familiarize themselves with their users.<br>The identity proofing and enrollment process sets the stage for a user’s interactions with a given CSP and the online services that the user will access; as negative first impressions can influence user perception of subsequent interactions, organizations need to promote a positive user experience throughout the process.<br>Usability cannot be achieved in a piecemeal manner. Performing a usability evaluation on the enrollment and identity proofing process is critical. It is important to conduct a usability evaluation with representative users, realistic goals and tasks, and appropriate contexts of use. The enrollment and identity proofing process should be designed and implemented so that it is easy for users to do the right thing, hard for them to do the wrong thing, and easy for them to recover when the wrong thing happens. [ISO/IEC9241-11], [ISO16982], and [ISO25060] provide guidance on how to evaluate the overall usability of an identity service and additional considerations for increasing usability.<br>From the user’s perspective, the three main steps of identity proofing and enrollment are pre-enrollment preparation, the enrollment and proofing session, and post-enrollment actions. These steps may occur in a single session or there could be significant time elapsed between each one (e.g., days or weeks).<br>General and step-specific usability considerations are described in sub-sections below.<br>Guidelines and considerations are described from the users’ perspective.<br>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [Section508] was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology and require federal agencies to make electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. While these guidelines do not directly assert requirements from Section 508, identity service providers are expected to comply with Section 508 provisions. Beyond compliance with Section 508, Federal Agencies and their service providers are generally expected to design services and systems with the experiences of people with disabilities in mind to ensure that accessibility is prioritized throughout identity system lifecycles., <strong>Source</strong>: nist 800-63a-4<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

All input should be neutralized, not just parameters that the user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including tag attributes, hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected to be redisplayed by the site. We often encounter data from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer. Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Output Encoding\nUse and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.\nThe problem of inconsistent output encodings often arises in web pages. If an encoding is not specified in an HTTP header, web browsers often guess about which encoding is being used. This can open up the browser to subtle XSS attacks.\nPhase: Implementation\nWith Struts, write all data from form beans with the bean's filter attribute set to true.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Attack Surface Reduction\nTo help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be HttpOnly. In browsers that support the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie. This is not a complete solution, since HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers. More importantly, XMLHTTPRequest and other powerful browser technologies provide read access to HTTP headers, including the Set-Cookie header in which the HttpOnly flag is set.\nEffectiveness: Defense in Depth\n, <strong>Source</strong>: OWASP<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/87.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 1]

Privacy Considerations, <strong>Subsection</strong>: 7.6 Agency-Specific Privacy Compliance, <strong>Content</strong>: The guidelines cover specific compliance obligations for federal CSPs. It is critical to involve an agency’s SAOP in the earliest stages of identity service development to assess and mitigate privacy risks and advise the agency on compliance requirements, such as whether or not the PII collection to conduct identity proofing triggers the Privacy Act of 1974 [PrivacyAct] or the E-Government Act of 2002 [E-Gov] requirement to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment. For example, with respect to identity proofing, it is likely that the Privacy Act requirements will be triggered and require coverage by either a new or existing Privacy Act system of records notice (SORN) due to the collection and maintenance of PII or other attributes necessary to conduct identity proofing.<br>The SAOP can similarly assist the agency in determining whether a PIA is required. These considerations should not be read as a requirement to develop a Privacy Act SORN or PIA for identity proofing alone; in many cases it will make the most sense to draft a PIA and SORN that encompasses the entire digital identity lifecycle or includes the identity proofing process as part of a larger, programmatic PIA that discusses the program or benefit to which the agency is establishing online access.<br>Due to the many components of the digital identity lifecycle, it is important for the SAOP to have an awareness and understanding of each individual component.

Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program. \n Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.\nThere are many ways an adversary can hijack DLL loads. Adversaries may plant trojan dynamic-link library files (DLLs) in a directory that will be searched before the location of a legitimate library that will be requested by a program, causing Windows to load their malicious library when it is called for by the victim program. Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks, \n by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL. Often this location is the current working directory of the program.\n Remote DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL. \nPhantom DLL hijacking is a specific type of DLL search order hijacking where adversaries target references to non-existent DLL files.\n They may be able to load their own malicious DLL by planting it with the correct name in the location of the missing module.\nAdversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry and creation of a redirection file) may cause a program to load a different DLL.\nIf a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level.

The highlights from the meeting include:\nThe experts from Telecom providers stressed the importance of keeping security and resilience legislation and leaving the specific technical details about security measures up to providers. Providers should be responsible for choosing the measures to meet the security and resilience objectives of governments.\nA major topic of debate was the impact of power cuts on electronic communications. Telecom providers are often kept in the dark about the quality and resilience of power supply and they are also often unaware about where outages are likely to occur. Providers should be better informed about on-going outages and what is the forecasted restoration time via priority channels. Telecoms are a critical sector and cannot be treated as normal domestic users. During the meeting it was also stressed that these issues cannot be left entirely to the market, as in many countries market mechanisms in the energy sector are hardly mature. Energy regulators or civil protection agencies should discuss with telecom regulators and telecom providers to address the critical dependency between the two sectors.\nExperts stressed the importance of using digital structured formats (XML, private RSS feeds, etc) for exchanging information about vulnerabilities and threats to prepare the ground for easier sharing of information with other providers and government authorities, nationally and across border.\nAn additional concern for telecom providers is the increased dependency on ICT products and the fact that many security incidents are caused by failures and vulnerabilities in ICT products and services. Providers encouraged  to develop a set of requirements for ICT vendors supplying products to the telecom sector.\n will continue to build up this group and work on specific security and resilience issues which affect providers across the European Union, acting as a bridge between the EU telecom market, telecom regulators and regulators in other sectors., <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/1st-meeting-of-enisa2019s-electronic-communications-reference-group-in-rome'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

The advertising industry has led the drive for new, persistent and powerful cookies, with privacy-invasive features for marketing practices and profiling. The Agency advocates e.g. that both the user browser and the origin server must assist informed consent, and that users should be able to easily manage their cookies. The Agency recommends a thorough study of different interpretations in the Member States, once the Directive 2009/136/EC has been implemented, by 25 May 2011.\n\nThe new\nAgency Position Paper\nidentifies and analyzes cookies in terms of security vulnerabilities and the relevant privacy concerns. Cookies were originally used to facilitate browser-server interaction. Lately, driven by the advertising industry, they are used for other purposes; e.g. advertising management, profiling, tracking, etc. The possibilities to misuse cookies both exist and are being exploited.\nThe new type of cookies support user-identification in a persistent manner and do not have enough transparency of how they are being used. Therefore, their security and privacy implications are not easily quantifiable. To mitigate the privacy implications, the Agency recommends, among other things, that:\n• Informed consent should guide the design of systems using cookies; the use of cookies and the data stored in cookies should be transparent for users.\n• Users should be able to easily manage cookies: in particular new cookie types. As such, all cookies should have user-friendly removal mechanisms which are easy to understand and use by any user.\n• Storage of cookies outside browser control should be limited or prohibited.\n• Users should be provided with another service channel if they do not accept cookies.\nThe\nExecutive Director of , Prof. Udo Helmbrecht\nunderlines;\n”Much work is needed to make these next-generation cookies as transparent and user-controlled as regular HTTP cookies, to safeguard the privacy and security aspects of consumers and business alike”.\nDr. José Fernandes, Director of Department for Development Support and Academia, Microsoft Portugal, stated “Every year more businesses come online using the Internet.

SHALL be limited to use by a single RP.\n2. SHALL be single-use.\n3. SHOULD be time limited with a short lifetime of seconds or minutes.\n4. SHOULD be presented along with authentication of the RP.\n\nIn this model, the RP directly requests the assertion from the IdP, minimizing chances of interception and manipulation by a third party (including the subscriber themselves).\n\nThis method also allows the RP to query the IdP for additional attributes about the subscriber not included in the assertion itself, since back-channel communication can continue to occur after the initial authentication transaction has been completed without sending the user back to the IdP.\n\nThis query occurs using an authorization component issued alongside the assertion, as described in [Section 6.](#page24)\n\nMore network transactions are required in the back-channel method, but the information is limited to only those parties that need it. Since an RP is expecting to get an assertion only from the IdP directly, the attack surface is reduced. Consequently, it is more difficult to inject assertions directly into the RP.\n\nThe RP SHALL protect itself against injection of manufactured or captured assertion references by use of cross-site scripting protection or other accepted techniques.\n\nElements within the assertion SHALL be validated by the RP, including:\n\n* Issuer verification: ensuring the assertion was issued by the IdP the RP expects it to be from.\n* Signature validation: ensuring the signature of the assertion corresponds to the key related to the IdP sending the assertion.\n* Time validation: ensuring the expiration and issue times are within acceptable limits of the current timestamp.\n* Audience restriction: ensuring this RP is the intended recipient of the assertion.\n\nConveyance of the assertion reference from the IdP to the subscriber, as well as from the subscriber to the RP, SHALL be made over an authenticated protected channel.

The IdP can do this by requiring the RP to authenticate itself when presenting the assertion reference to the IdP or through other similar means (see [RFC 7636](#page48) for one protocol’s method of RP identification).\n\nNote that in a federation proxy described in [Section 5.1.4,](#page21) the IdP audience restricts the assertion reference and assertion to the proxy, and the proxy restricts any newly-created assertion references or assertions to the downstream RP., <strong>Source</strong>: nist 800-63c-3<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63c.pdf'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Among the advantages is the opportunity to exchange information, knowledge, expertise and good practices (25%), the opportunity to influence the decision making process (16,10%) and effective networking opportunities (17,90%). Factors impeding participation in these cooperation initiatives is because it’s uncommon in their sector of activity (35, 7%) or because these initiatives are not used in the countries in which the organisation operates (20%).\nThe EP3R participants initiated many discussions, saw a lot of commitment, and produced interesting conclusions. The scheme proved appropriate for addressing complex cooperation problems within multi-stakeholder scenarios and cooperation issues in security and resilience. It also revealed some further needs in security and resilience, and the gaps to be filled in order to reach a higher maturity level of the Telecom Sector. Key recommendations for the future include four main points:\nImplement agile PPPs which can adapt to new needs and topics;\nIncentivise Industry initiatives;\nDefine simple but formal rules and governance;\nPublish and advertise successful results\nThe EP3R (European Public-Private Partnership for Resilience) was established in 2009 and was the very first attempt at Pan-European level to use a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) to address cross-border Security and Resilience concerns in the Telecom Sector. In 2011  published a\nGood Practice Guide on Cooperative Models for Effective PPPs\nand implemented the suggested features in the EP3R for the second half of its existence.\nFor full report:\nEP3R 2009-2013 Future of NIS Public Private Cooperation, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/conclusion-for-the-european-public-private-partnership-ppp-for-resilience-scheme'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

[15.379417419433594, 0.6118139624595642, "<strong>Content</strong>: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory\n('Path Traversal') # Description : \n\n\n# Extend Description : \nExtended Description\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Input Validation\nAssume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\nWhen validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \".\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as\nCWE-23\n, and exclude directory separators such as \"/\" to avoid\nCWE-36\n. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid\nCWE-434\n.\nDo not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (\nCWE-184\n). For example, filtering \"/\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \"\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (\nCWE-182\n). For example, if \"../\" sequences are removed from the \".../...//\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \"../\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \"../\" string.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nFor any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid\nCWE-602\n. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Input Validation\nInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (\nCWE-180\n). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (\nCWE-174\n). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.\nUse a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes \"..\" sequences and symbolic links (\nCWE-23\n,\nCWE-59\n). This includes:\nrealpath() in C\ngetCanonicalPath() in Java\nGetFullPath() in ASP.NET\nrealpath() or abs_path() in Perl\nrealpath() in PHP\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nStrategy: Libraries or Frameworks\nUse a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.\nPhase: Operation\nStrategy: Firewall\nUse an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.\nEffectiveness: Moderate\nNote:\nAn application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.\nPhases: Architecture and Design; Operation\nStrategy: Environment Hardening\nRun your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [\nREF-76\n]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.\nPhase: Architecture and Design\nStrategy: Enforcement by Conversion\nWhen the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.\nFor example, ID 1 could map to \"inbox.txt\" and ID 2 could map to \"profile.txt\". Features such as the ESAPI AccessReferenceMap [\nREF-185\n] provide this capability.\nPhases: Architecture and Design; Operation\nStrategy: Sandbox or Jail\nRun the code in a \"jail\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.\nOS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.\nThis may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.\nBe careful to avoid\nCWE-243\nand other weaknesses related to jails.\nEffectiveness: Limited\nNote:\nThe effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.\nPhases: Architecture and Design; Operation\nStrategy: Attack Surface Reduction\nStore library, include, and utility files outside of the web document root, if possible. Otherwise, store them in a separate directory and use the web server's access control capabilities to prevent attackers from directly requesting them. One common practice is to define a fixed constant in each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately.\nThis significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce the attack surface.\nPhase: Implementation\nEnsure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.\nIf errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.\nAvoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.\nIn the context of path traversal, error messages which disclose path information can help attackers craft the appropriate attack strings to move through the file system hierarchy.\nPhases: Operation; Implementation\nStrategy: Environment Hardening\nWhen using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as\nCWE-95\n,\nCWE-621\n, and similar issues.\n, <strong>Source</strong>: OWASP<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 1]

Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.\nAn adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e. \n) or used to spawn a new process (i.e. \n). An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.\nAny standard user can use the \n command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account.

The report identifies the top emerging risks and makes 18 non-technical recommendations for their mitigation. One key recommendation is to strengthen Member State’s law enforcement agencies. Other recommendations point to safeguards adapted to the needs of youth’s cyber activities.\nDigital devices and the internet now play a significant role in children’s lives. Today’s young people live their online lives in both private and educational settings. This is an environment radically different from that of their parents, in their childhoods.

Many parents lose control, as they lack knowledge and tools to support their children, the report argues. The Agency thus issues 18 recommendations\nto mitigate identified risks. Among the key recommendations are:\nStrengthening of law enforcement agencies by the Member States:\nadditional knowledge and resources is important. This additional strength is needed to properly cover regulatory issues, statistical data collection of misuse cases, and follow up on privacy breaches\nCivil society and social partners need knowledge sources\nregarding the use of Internet and online services. Furthermore, sponsored online campaigns to prevent grooming/cyber bullying should take place in social networks.\nParents/guardians/educators need better technological skills\nto overcome the knowledge gap between adults and teenagers.\nFor teenagers, the mitigation measures\nfor the identified risks include:\n- Use of specialised teenager security settings,  and adaptation of  existing ones to teenager needs\n- Privacy impact assessment for applications processing teenager’s data\n- Development of mechanisms to allow deactivation of all active (online) components\n- Age oriented access control mechanisms\n- Among the top risks for teenagers, out of a total of 13 identified, are:\nsuffering serious loss of physical or mental health; irreversibly exposing important personal information online; discrimination based on your online behaviour, and misuse of personal data.\nFor full report\nincluding all risks and recommendations to different target audiences.\nFor interviews or further details:\nUlf Bergstrom, Spokesman, ,\npress@.europa.eu\n, Mobile: + 30 6948 460 143 or Louis Marinos, Expert,\nriskmanagement@.europa.eu, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/new-report-cyber-bullying-online-grooming-18-protective-recommendations-against-key-risks'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Member States should therefore work together with  to ensure that national schemes can be combined in a sensible manner to support information exchange across the EU\nFoster public - private collaboration on cyber security\nUse cybersecurity as an economic enabler\nDevelop and maintain clear cybersecurity strategies\nDevelop awareness and training in the area of cybersecurity\nContinue to develop and empower national CSIRTs\nDevelop and implement effective incident reporting schemes for cyber security incidents.\nUse risk-based approaches to securing governmental services\nImprove cooperation between communities and across national borders to improve threat intelligence and promote the application of good practices, and\nEnsure smooth implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nIn his interview Paulo Empadinhas said: “More cooperation is needed along with a higher level of awareness of all levels of society without forgetting the EU citizens”. He highlighted the work  - the EU cyber security Agency - is delivering for Europe, gaining ground in some areas where Member States understand the need of adequate legislation, with the good examples of the NIS Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). He added: “Europe is growing more and more digital, with the next generation of citizens, politicians and entrepreneurs thinking more about security and privacy by design at the stage of the development of new products and services.\"\nMore about the\nevent\nMore about EIF\nand\n#EIFonline, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-at-eif-meeting-on-trust-cybersecurity'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Participants also offered their views on the initial findings from the  Cybersecurity for SMEs report, due out in the coming months.\nAccounting for more than half of Europe’s GDP, SMEs are a key driver of innovation and growth across the Union. Their well-being is vital to both the economy and society. The pandemic has put an incredible stress on these businesses this year. SMEs are not only navigating a new digital realm where employees work from home and business is increasingly conducted online, but they are also facing more advanced and targeted cyber threats.\nDr.\nEvangelos Ouzounis\n, Head of the Secure Infrastructure and Services Unit of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, opened the one-day workshop with a keynote speech about the Agency’s work with SMEs - from publishing guidance on best practices to gathering stakeholders across communities to increase cybersecurity awareness. Dr. Ouzounis introduced\nOana-Georgiana Popescu\nof the Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (EASME), who discussed the European Innovation Council Accelerator’s community platform, and connection to the research and innovation programme, Horizon Europe (2021-2027).\nModerated by Ms. Popescu, panellists from SMEs with expertise in cybersecurity and information technology discussed current obstacles and their efforts towards increasing cyber resiliency.\nBrian Honan\n, founder of Ireland-based BH Consulting, highlighted the dangers of social engineering attacks.\nAntonio Ramos\n, CEO of Leet Security in Spain, presented cybersecurity capability building models and security governance. Peter Stelzhammer, co-founder of Austria’s AV Comparatives, offered examples of anti-malware solutions.\nPiotr Żabrowski\nof Poland’s Ceneo.pl discussed cybersecurity in the e-commerce sector.\nThe event highlighted SME’s increasing need for the right tools to stay ahead of the game and be prepared for cyber threats before they happen. Participants welcomed the work and involvement of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity and expressed a great interest in participating in further SME-targeted initiatives by the Agency.\nBackground\nFor nearly 15 years, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity has been pushing forward cybersecurity initiatives to assist SMEs to integrate cybersecurity into their digital environments. Starting in 2006 and 2007, the Agency published two\nInformation Package for SMEs\nreports, providing risk assessment and management methodologies for SMEs. In 2010, the Agency published the\nBusiness Continuity for SMEs\nreport to help facilitate IT knowledge transfer to SMEs. In 2015, the\nCloud Security Guide for SMEs\nreport was released to assist SMEs understand the security risks and opportunities regarding cloud services; and two years later, the Agency’s\nGuidelines for SMEs on the security of personal data processing\nwere published.\nThis year, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity has released a series of tips to help businesses face the rapidly changing digital sphere during the pandemic:\nTips for selecting and using online communication tools\n;\nTips for cybersecurity when buying and selling online\n;\nTips for cybersecurity when working from home\n;\nTop ten cyber hygiene tips for SMEs during covid-19 pandemic\n. Most recently, in November 2020, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity and the National Cyber Security Alliance released a\njoint checklist for SME\n, offering businesses on both sides of the Atlantic a basic guide to maintaining digital security.\nThe upcoming ‘Cybersecurity for SMEs: Challenges and Recommendations’ report is part of the Agency’s wider work to increase the cybersecurity resiliency of SMEs across Europe. The publication is based on a two-month-long public survey in which more than 250 European SMEs identified their main cybersecurity challenges and their level of preparedness to cope with the most common cyber threats.\nPress Contact\nFor questions related to the press and interviews, please contact\npress (at) .europa.eu\n., <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-smes-facing-increased-cyber-threats-in-a-changing-digital-landscape'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Integrity is the element of managing the supply chain that this report focusses on, with a view to providing guidance to EU member states. This paper identifies what the Supply Chain and Integrity means in the ICT context.\nSafe products, systems and components -from the start till end?\nSupply chains have become increasingly global in recent years and have become longer both geographically and in the number of supply elements. This is consistent with the globalisation of markets, and the move away from a major industry and its suppliers being geographically locally limited to each other. Telecommunications operators and equipment manufacturers increasingly rely on globally sourced components. For niche markets, a single supplier may support the entire industry (e.g. Microsoft supplying Operating Systems to 83% of the PC market) with distribution channels serving the dependent markets. A characteristic of the ICT market is the ability to distribute software, firmware and chip designs in “soft formats”; this gives a different perspective to ICT supply chain analysis in relation to other forms of raw material, logistic distribution networks, and staff.\nStructure of supply chains\nA supply chain is not really a chain with each link joining two  suppliers together in a single path from the start till the end of the chain. A loss of a single link would then be visible and the impact instant – the chain breaks.  In practice, supply chains are more like the fishbone structure.\nICT supply chain integrity is consequently relevant for both hardware (PC:s USB, etc) and software products, as well as and services (system of apparatus, appliances, employees, etc). Product oriented supply chains can consist of software and hardware design, testing, production, delivery, repair, support, and maintenance, as well as organizations, people, and processes, engaged in its operations. Supply chains related to telecommunications services include network design, testing, installation, network management.\nThe increased demand for security-supply chain integrity.\nThis report originates on the assertion that Governments, corporations, organizations, and consumers are increasingly reliant on ICT products and services to protect the society and economy. As a result of this, reliance and security threats to ICT supply chains have attracted more attention, including the threat of intentional tampering during development, distribution or operations, or the threat of substitution with counterfeit (including cloned or overproduced) components before or during delivery, and attacks against the economy through the supply chain.\nRecommendations\nThe present report identifies the nature of these threats and examines the strategies used to counter them. The report finally recommends that supply chain actors follow a core set of good practices to provide a common basis to assess and manage ICT supply chain risk –Moreover, the report recognise that governments must work in collaboration with private industry to build international assessment frameworks., <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/new-report-on-supply-chain-integrity-launched'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

It addresses common concepts, definitions, certifications of different types, as well as clarifies the mandatory and legal background for some certifications. It also explores the analogies and disparities between a number of existing certification schemes. Finally, it analyses current trends in certification and offers six recommendations to improve network and information security in Europe through a wider use of security certification.\nSome of the key  recommendations in the report include, in brief:\nGenerally speaking\n, organisations should verify their information security management systems, choose certified security products and encourage security employees to choose appropriate personal information security certifications.\nFor processes\n, the development of the complementary standards of the 27000 family for public and private organisations should be encouraged, e.g. an ISO27001 ‘light’ for SMEs.\nAs concerns products\n, the EU should extend the intergovernmental Mutual Recognition Agreement on Common Criteria to all Member States, as a tool for a more secure e-Communication market. EU Framework Programme 7 should sponsor research to analyse the economics of the certification of products.\nAbout people\n, the EU should strength accreditation schemes related to people certification in IT security and encourage the development of people certification adapted to different profiles, from the end-user level (Computer Driving Licence) to the most professional one (e.g. IT security officer).The EU should also reinforce bridges between education (schools and universities) and the certification process (private training and certificate providers).\nFor full recommendations, please refer to\nthe full report\n.\nThe\nExecutive Director\nof  and the\nHead of Technical Department Dr Alain Esterle\ncomment:\n\"'s report is setting the right course for an improved market of IT security certifications, which are crucial for products, people and processes\"\nWhy is studying certifications important?\nAccreditation and certification schemes are a major vector to strengthen user’s confidence in network and information security and improve business and competitiveness in Europe.

Identity Proofing Requirements, <strong>Subsection</strong>: 3.1.13.1 Trusted Referees Requirements, <strong>Content</strong>: To increase accessibility and promote equal access to online government services, CSPs provide trusted referees. Trusted referees are used to facilitate the identity proofing and enrollment of individuals who are otherwise unable to meet the requirements for identity proofing to a specific IAL. A non-exhaustive list of examples of such individuals and demographic groups includes: individuals who do not possess and cannot obtain the required identity evidence; persons with disabilities; older individuals; persons experiencing homelessness; individuals with little or no access to online services or computing devices; persons without a bank account or with limited credit history; victims of identity theft; individuals displaced or affected by natural disasters; and children under 18. The following requirements apply to the use of trusted referees:\n\n1. The CSP SHALL provide notification to the public of the availability of trusted referee services and how such services are obtained.\n2. The CSP SHALL establish written policies and procedures for the use of trusted referees as part of its practice statement, as specified in Sec. 3.1.1.\n3. The CSP SHALL train and certify its trusted referees to make risk-based decisions that allow applicants to be successfully identity proofed based on their unique circumstances. At a minimum such training SHALL include:\n    - Document identification and validation, such as common templates, security features, layouts, and topography.\n    - Indicators of fraudulent documents, such as damage, tampering, modification, and material types\n    - Facial and image comparisons to conduct verification of applicants against presented documents\n    - Indicators of social engineering - such as distress, confusion, or coercion - exhibited by an applicant\n    - Annual recertification of the trusted referee’s capabilities\n4. The CSP SHALL establish a record of any identity proofing session that involves a trusted referee, to include: what evidence was presented; which processes were completed (e.g., validation or verification); and, the reason(s) why a trusted referee was used (e.g., automated process failure, applicant request, established exception policy).\n5. The CSP MAY offer trusted referee services for either onsite-attended or remote-attended sessions. These sessions SHALL be consistent with the requirements of these proofing types based on the IAL of the proofing event., <strong>Source</strong>: nist 800-63a-4<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 109/67 (IT) Wednesday, March 20, 2024.  31-year-old Sandu Boris Diaconu was sentenced to 42 months in prison in the U.S. for operating an illegal marketplace called E-Root Marketplace, which offered 350,000 stolen credentials for sale. He was charged with conspiracy to commit access device fraud and computer fraud, and possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices. He pleaded guilty on December 1, 2023.  The E-Root Marketplace operated through a widely distributed network and was able to hide the identities of administrators, buyers, and sellers. Buyers could search for compromised computer credentials on E-Root, such as usernames and passwords, that would allow buyers to remotely access computers for the purpose of stealing personal information or manipulating computer content remotely. The marketplace also concealed transaction paths by using an online payment system called Perfect Money, which allowed Bitcoin to be converted to Perfect Money.  The infrastructure associated with E-Root and Perfect Money was seized by law enforcement in late 2020.  It is estimated that more than 350,000 credentials were advertised for sale in the illegal marketplace, with many victims falling under ransomware attacks and tax fraud schemes. , <strong>Source</strong>: Thai-CERT<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.thaicert.or.th/2024/03/20/%e0%b8%9c%e0%b8%b9%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%94%e0%b8%b9%e0%b9%81%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%b0%e0%b8%9a%e0%b8%9a-e-root-marketplace-%e0%b8%96%e0%b8%b9%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%95%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%94%e0%b8%aa%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%99/'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 1]

Objectives of this report are:\nto identify gaps between available training courses, certifications and NIS education needs with particular emphasis on ePrivacy\nto suggest further actions based on the analysed needs of NIS communities in Europe\nFrom the desktop research, the focus for most of the courses that included privacy appeared to be in computer science, computer security, information security, cybercrime and the cyber security area. However there were a number of courses which included privacy law (Information Technology, Commercial, Corporate, Communications and Property), marketing and ethics. For several reasons, it may be, that privacy is an area that only relatively lately is gathering attention, compared for example to Network and Information Security. However this idea would require further future research to be proved.\nWithin this context, existing Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) were also looked into. In terms of MOOCs, the offer around the subject of privacy and data protection is limited in general, and there is a particular lack of MOOCs in the European context both in terms of delivery by European Universities/Institutes and covering privacy and data protection legislations and debates at a European level. Furthermore, MOOCs and serious games are a path which is being explored as a practical way to transfer knowledge, support learning, raise awareness, offer professional training and unveil controversial issues and practices surrounding privacy and data protection.\n’s recommendations on MOOCs courses\nIn the final section of the report, recommendations are provided for EU level organisations, e.g. University networks, users’ coalitions and multipliers, education institutions, and also at the Member State level organisations e.g. education institutions, NGOs, think tanks, governments.\nKey recommendations include:\nConsider exploring serious games not only for raising awareness but also as a training ground for first-responders and other professionals.\nThe report has highlighted that privacy does not seem to feature in titles of undergraduate degree courses and further research would be required to understand why.\nConsider to invest in MOOCs with a NIS focus, in particular addressing the issue of privacy-by-design and European legislation. We highlighted that some of the existing MOOCs are available in national languages, this is clearly an advantage and a best practice. The report has highlighted that there is scope for some specific MOOCs relating with issues currently debated at a European level. There is a general lack on privacy and data protection MOOCs in the EU context, however this delivery opportunity could be better exploited also via existing supported platforms (i.e. OpenUpEd and EMMA).\nConsider promoting the creation of multiple such quizzes using as basis or parts of the  quiz in order to raise awareness by participating in the spread of general quizzes and awareness month.\nUser education is key in cyber security\nAt the same time,  has further developed a\nquiz\n(to be officially launched on Monday 26.10) to test user’s knowledge in network and information security while at the same time to disseminate best practices and knowledge from all its reports.

Insurance federations have also shown a great interest in cyber-insurance, with actions taking place both at the European and national level.\nA rising concern among a number of insurers is found to be the uncertainty around accumulating risk[3]. A subset of key recommendations, for the betterment of the cyber insurance constituency, to policy makers, insurance companies, and future customers include:\nTo policy makers:\navoid the introduction of mandatory requirements that might undermine the cyber-insurance market adoption rate\nTo insurance companies:\na) consider adopting common standards and methodologies, b) introduce explanatory sessions, and provide customer scenarios and generic examples of policy coverage and c) clarify the policy language and offer a transparent underwriting process\nTo cyber insurance customers:\nget informed, prepare and document the environment before requesting a cyber-insurance policy.\nThe report is targeted primarily at insurance companies, to either benchmark themselves against the market trends, or evaluate good practices before entering the market. Additional beneficiaries are customers interested to adopt a cyber insurance policy. Founded to address residual risk, the cyber insurance market is anticipating a growth in both technological and sales volume terms; a growth that is expected to be further accelerated by the legislative additions of the GDPR and NIS Directive.\nFull report\nis available\nhere\nFor interviews and press enquiries please contact\npress@.europa.eu\n[1] France, ANSSI “40 essential measures for a healthy network”\nhttp://bit.ly/2dr6nbA\n[2] United Kingdom, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy “Cyber essentials scheme: overview”\nhttp://bit.ly/1hkkmdz\n[3] For example, in the event that an incident would occur an insurer cannot be certain about the number of customers that would be affected., <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cyber-insurance-a-look-at-recent-advances-good-practices-and-challenges-by-enisa'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Depending on the implementation, consider form-factor constraints, which are particularly problematic when users must enter text on mobile devices. Providing larger touch areas will improve usability for entering secrets on mobile devices.      Consider offering features that do not require text entry on mobile devices (e.g., a copy-paste feature), which are particularly helpful when the primary and secondary channels are on the same device. For example, it is difficult for users to transfer the authentication secret manually using a smartphone because they must switch back and forth — potentially multiple times — between the out-of-band application and the primary channel.      Messages and notifications to out-of-band devices should contain contextual information for the user, such as the name of the service being accessed.      Out-of-band messages should be delivered in a consistent manner and style to aid the subscriber in identifying potentially suspicious authentication requests., <strong>Source</strong>: nist 800-63b-4<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Where Europe once led the world in the deployment of initially analogue and then mobile telecommunications technology such as GSM, Europe is now debating the appropriateness of the supply of 5G technology from non-European suppliers. Traditional EU mobile handset manufacturers are struggling to compete with major Asian and US suppliers.\nMoreover, successful European businesses have been or are often acquired by larger companies from outside the EU. It is surprising to see how the European ICT industry is falling behind in the global competition race, while according to the European Commission, the EU Member States are among the most digitally advanced in the world.\nExecutive Director of  Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht:\n“The question is if and why are examples of European leadership in ICT beginning to fade. Is there insufficient coordination in relation to cybersecurity in the EU? Could resources be deployed more efficiently? These are some of the questions that are being presented for discussion. We look forward to receiving your input into this consultation.”\nThe public consultation was announced by the executive director, Udo Helmbrecht at the\nCODE conference 2019\n, where he moderated a panel titled \"How to Achieve Digital Sovereignty of Europe?\". The panel of high-level speakers included Klaus Vitt, State Secretary, Federal Ministry of Interior, Building and Community, Benedikt Zimmer, State Secretary, Federal Ministry of Defence, Roberto Viola, Director-General Communications Networks, Content and Technology, European Commission, Jorge Domecq, Executive Director, European Defence Agency and Evert Dudok, Executive Vice President Communications, Intelligence and Security, Airbus Defence and Space.

Subscriber-Provided Bound Authenticator Binding Ceremony, <strong>Content</strong>: The RP MAY provide a process for associating subscriber-provided authenticators to the RP subscriber account on a trust-on-first-use basis. This process is known as a binding ceremony and has additional requirements beyond a typical FAL3 federation process. This is similar to the subscriber-provided authenticator binding process discussed in Sec. 4.1.3 of [SP800-63B].If no bound authenticators are associated with the RP subscriber account, the RP SHALL perform a binding ceremony to establish the connection between the authenticator, the subscriber, and the RP subscriber account as shown in Fig. 5. The RP SHALL first establish an authenticated session using federation with an assertion that meets all the other requirements of FAL3, including an indication that the assertion is intended for use at FAL3 with a bound authenticator. The subscriber SHALL immediately be prompted to present and authenticate with the proposed authenticator. Upon successful presentation of the authenticator, the RP SHALL store a unique identifier for the authenticator (such as its public key) and associate this with the RP subscriber account associated with the federated identifier. If the subscriber fails to successfully authenticate to the RP using an appropriate authenticator, the binding ceremony fails. The binding ceremony session SHALL have a timeout of five minutes or less and SHALL NOT be used as an authenticated session for any other purpose as described in Sec. 3.8. Upon successful completion of the binding ceremony, the RP SHALL immediately request a new assertion from the IdP at FAL3, including prompting the subscriber for the newly-bound authenticator.Fig. 5. Subscriber-Provided Bound Authenticator Binding CeremonyAn RP MAY allow a subscriber to bind multiple subscriber-provided authenticators at FAL3. If this is the case, and the RP subscriber account has one or more existing bound authenticators, the binding ceremony makes use of the existing ability to reach FAL3. The subscriber SHALL first be prompted to authenticate to the RP with an existing bound authenticator to reach FAL3. Upon successful authentication, the RP SHALL immediately prompt the subscriber to authenticate to the RP using the newly-bound authenticator.In addition to an RP determining a bound authenticator is no longer viable, a subscriber could choose to stop using a bound authenticator for a variety of reasons, such as the authenticator being lost, compromised, or no longer usable due to technology and platform changes.In such cases, an RP MAY allow a subscriber to remove a subscriber-provided bound authenticator from their RP subscriber account, thereby removing the ability to use that authenticator for FAL3 sessions. When a bound authenticator is removed, the RP SHALL terminate all current FAL3 sessions for the subscriber and SHALL require reauthentication at FAL3 of the subscriber from the IdP. The RP SHALL NOT prompt the subscriber to authenticate with the authenticator being removed, since the subscriber will often not have access to the authenticator in question during the unbinding process, particularly in cases where the authenticator is lost or compromised.This option is particularly helpful in situations where the subscriber already has access to an appropriate authenticator that the RP wants to allow them to use for FAL3 transactions.For example, a subscriber could have a single-factor cryptographic authenticator which uses name-based phishing resistance as described in Sec. 3.2.5.2 of [SP800-63B]. With such a device, the IdP and RP would see different keys when the authenticator is used in each location, meaning the bound authenticator cannot be easily verified by the IdP. Furthermore, since the RP did not issue the authenticator, the RP does not know the authenticator’s key ahead of time, nor does it know which subscriber account to associate to the key. Instead, the RP can use a binding ceremony as described here to allow the subscriber to use this device as a bound authenticator at FAL3.A more complete example is found in Sec 10.7., <strong>Source</strong>: nist 800-63c-4<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 0]

Anonymisation technologies and peer-to peer systems (so called distributed technologies) play an important role in this.  It is clear that mobile technology is increasingly exploited by cyber-criminals. Threats of all kinds that were encountered in the more traditional arena of IT will affect mobile devices and the services available on these platforms.\nThe wide spread of mobile devices leads to an amplification of abuse based on knowledge/attack methods targeting social media.\nThe availability of malware and cyber-hacking tools and services, together with digital currencies (e.g. Bitcoins) and anonymous payment services is opening up new avenues for cyber-fraud and criminal activity.\nThere is a real possibility of large impact events when attacks combining various threats are successfully launched.\nAs reported by  in its\nreport on major cyber attacks\n(2013/07/20), cyber-attack is the sixth most important cause of outages in telecommunication infrastructures, and it impacts upon a considerable number of users. Taking into account these incidents, and denial of service threat developments, we observe an increase in infrastructure threats in 2013.\nThe study identifies the following top threats with major impact since 2012.\nDrive-by-exploits:\nbrowser-based attacks still remain the most reported threats, and Java remains the most exploited software for this kind of threat.\nCode Injection:\nattacks are notably popular against web site Content Management Systems (CMSs).

It serves as a reference point in this field  and as a foundation for relevant forthcoming initiatives and developments. The  report was developed in cooperation with the  IoT Security Experts Group and additional key stakeholders.\nSecurity recommendations crucial for functionality\n defines IoT as “a cyber-physical ecosystem of interconnected sensors and actuators, which enables intelligent decision making”. IoT brings the smart element into every life aspect of Europeans, from smart cars and wearables to smart grids and infrastructures. The threats and risks related to IoT devices, systems and services are growing, and new attacks are covered by the media every day.\n“The deployment of IoT will be key to our smart cities, smart airports, smart health and smart X. It is envisaged, that IoT will be deployed everywhere and will have a positive impact on our lives. The deployment of baseline security recommendations into our IoT ecosystem will be critical to the proper function of these devices by mitigating and preventing cyber-attacks.”, said Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of .\nExtremely complex landscape\nWith a great impact on citizens’ safety, security and privacy, the IoT threat landscape is extremely complex. Therefore, it is important to understand what exactly needs to be secured and to implement specific security measures to protect the IoT from cyber threats. This is particularly important in the context of ICT systems, which are either critical infrastructures themselves or essential for the operation of critical infrastructures.\nThe  report provides IoT experts, developers, manufacturers, decision makers and security personnel with a guide to good practices and recommendations on preventing and mitigating cyber-attacks against IoT.\nFollowing a horizontal approach, ’s report aims to define a common background between particularities of diverse, vertical IoT application areas with a focus on critical infrastructures. The report builds on the expertise and insight previously gained by  through its sectorial studies on smart infrastructures such as smart homes, smart cities, intelligent public transport, smart cars, smart airports and eHealth (available on ’s website).\nThe recommendations of the report are meant to be of use to all actors involved, from the European Commission and governments to the IoT industry, providers, operators, manufacturers and consumers’ associations.\nIoT is entering into all aspects all life so there is a need for a strong holistic approach and to:\nPromote harmonization of IoT security initiatives and regulations;\nRaise awareness of the need for IoT cybersecurity;\nDefine secure software and hardware development lifecycle guidelines for IoT;\nAchieve consensus on interoperability across the IoT ecosystem;\nFoster economic and administrative incentives for IoT security;\nEstablishment of secure IoT product/service lifecycle management;\nClarify liability among IoT stakeholders.\n’s future work in the field will be focused on enhancing the security and resilience of IoT in Europe, engaging all relevant key stakeholders and providing studies and knowledge to face the upcoming challenges. The baseline security requirements for IoT in critical infrastructures presented in this report can serve as a foundation for further efforts towards a harmonised EU approach to IoT security.\nDownload the report:\nBaseline Security Recommendations for IoT, <strong>Source</strong>: ENISA<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/defining-and-securing-the-internet-of-things'>Link Document</a>", "2xxx", 1]

Assertions, <strong>Content</strong>: An assertion used for authentication is a packaged set of attribute values or attribute references about or associated with an authenticated subscriber that is passed from the IdP to the RP in a federated identity system. Assertions contain a variety of information, including: assertion metadata, attribute values and attribute references about the subscriber, information about the subscriber's authentication at the IdP, and other information that the RP can leverage (such as restrictions and expiration time). While the assertion’s primary function is to authenticate the user to an RP, the information conveyed in the assertion can be used by the RP for a number of use cases — for example, authorization or personalization of a website. These guidelines do not restrict RP use cases nor the type of protocol or data payload used to federate an identity, provided the chosen solution meets all mandatory requirements contained herein.\n\nAssertions MAY represent only an authentication event, or MAY also represent attribute values and attribute references regarding the subscriber.\n\nAll assertions SHALL include the following assertion metadata:\n\n1. Subject: An identifier for the party that the assertion is about (i.e., the subscriber).\n2. Issuer: An identifier for the IdP that issued the assertion.\n3. Audience: An identifier for the party intended to consume the assertion (i.e., the RP).\n4. Issuance: A timestamp indicating when the IdP issued the assertion.\n5. Expiration: A timestamp indicating when the assertion expires and SHALL no longer be accepted as valid by the RP (i.e., the expiration of the assertion and not the expiration of the session at the RP).\n6. Identifier: A value uniquely identifying this assertion, used to prevent attackers from replaying prior assertions.\n7. Signature: Digital signature or message authentication code (MAC), including key identifier or public key associated with the IdP, for the entire assertion.\n8. Authentication Time: A timestamp indicating when the IdP last verified the presence of the subscriber at the IdP through a primary authentication event (if available).\n\nAssertions MAY also include the following information:\n\n1. Key binding: Public key or key identifier of subscriber-held key to demonstrate their binding with the assertion described in [Section 6.1.2.](#page25)\n2. Attribute values and attribute references: Information about the subscriber.\n3. Attribute metadata: Additional information about one or more subscriber attributes, such as that described in NIST Internal Report 8112 [[NISTIR 8112](#page48)].\n\nAssertions SHOULD specify the AAL when an authentication event is being asserted and IAL when identity proofed attributes (or references based thereon) are being asserted. If not specified, the RP SHALL NOT assign any specific IAL or AAL to the assertion.\n\nAn RP SHALL treat subject identifiers as not inherently globally unique. Instead, the value of the assertion’s subject identifier is usually in a namespace under the assertion issuer’s control. This allows an RP to talk to multiple IdPs without incorrectly conflating subjects from different IdPs.\n\nAssertions MAY include additional attributes. [Section 7](#page29) contains privacy requirements for presenting attributes in assertions. The RP MAY fetch additional identity attributes from the IdP in one or more separate transactions using an authorization component issued alongside the original assertion. The ability to successfully fetch such additional attributes SHALL NOT be treated as equivalent to processing the assertion.\n\nAlthough details vary based on the exact federation protocol in use, an assertion SHOULD be used only to represent a single login event at the RP. After the RP consumes the assertion, session management by the RP comes into play (see [SP 800-63B](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b) Section 7); an assertion SHALL NOT be used past the expiration time contained therein. However, the expiration of the session at the RP MAY occur prior to the assertion’s expiration. See [Section 5.3](#page23) for more information.\n\nThe assertion’s lifetime is the time between its issuance and its expiration. This lifetime needs to be long enough to allow the RP to process the assertion and create a local application session for the subscriber, but should not be longer than necessary for such establishment. Long-lived assertions have a greater risk of being stolen or replayed; a short assertion lifetime mitigates this risk. Assertion lifetimes SHALL NOT be used to limit the session at the RP.

These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\n# Migration : \nPotential Mitigations\nPhase: Implementation\nDevelopers should anticipate that special elements (e.g. delimiters, symbols) will be injected into input vectors of their product. One defense is to create an allowlist (e.g. a regular expression) that defines valid input according to the requirements specifications. Strictly filter any input that does not match against the allowlist. Properly encode your output, and quote any elements that have special meaning to the component with which you are communicating.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Input Validation\nAssume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\nPhase: Implementation\nUse and specify an appropriate output encoding to ensure that the special elements are well-defined. A normal byte sequence in one encoding could be a special element in another.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Input Validation\nInputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (\nCWE-180\n). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (\nCWE-174\n). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.\nPhase: Implementation\nStrategy: Output Encoding\nWhile it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (\nCWE-88\n).\n, <strong>Source</strong>: OWASP<br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/138.html'>Link Document</a></br>", "2xxx", 1]

Glossary, <strong>Content</strong>: A wide variety of terms are used in the realm of digital identity. While many definitions are consistent with earlier versions of SP 800-63, some have changed in this revision. Many of these terms lack a single, consistent definition, warranting careful attention to how the terms are defined here.These are further divided into short-term authentication secrets, which are only useful to an attacker for a limited period of time, and long-term authentication secrets, which allow an attacker to impersonate the subscriber until they are manually reset. The authenticator secret is the canonical example of a long-term authentication secret, while the authenticator output — if it is different from the authenticator secret — is usually a short-term authentication secret.A credential is issued, stored, and maintained by the CSP. Copies of information from the credential can be possessed by the subscriber, typically in the form of one or more digital certificates that are often contained in an authenticator along with their associated private keys.For example, if a bank website is vulnerable to a CSRF attack, it may be possible for a subscriber to unintentionally authorize a large money transfer by clicking on a malicious link in an email while a connection to the bank is open in another browser window.FIPS documents are available online on the FIPS home page: https://www.nist.gov/itl/fips.cfmOne-way — It is computationally infeasible to find any input that maps to any pre-specified output.Collision-resistant — It is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs that map to the same output.A protected session is said to be authenticated if — during the session — one participant proves possession of one or more authenticators in addition to the session keys, and if the other party can verify the identity associated with the authenticators.

Adversaries may abuse email forwarding rules to monitor the activities of a victim, steal information, and further gain intelligence on the victim or the victim’s organization to use as part of further exploits or operations.\n Furthermore, email forwarding rules can allow adversaries to maintain persistent access to victim's emails even after compromised credentials are reset by administrators.\n Most email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including forwarding to a different recipient. These rules may be created through a local email application, a web interface, or by command-line interface. Messages can be forwarded to internal or external recipients, and there are no restrictions limiting the extent of this rule. Administrators may also create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and outcomes.\nAny user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) can create rules to automatically forward all received messages to another recipient, forward emails to different locations based on the sender, and more. Adversaries may also hide the rule by making use of the Microsoft Messaging API (MAPI) to modify the rule properties, making it hidden and not visible from Outlook, OWA or most Exchange Administration tools.\nIn some environments, administrators may be able to enable email forwarding rules that operate organization-wide rather than on individual inboxes. For example, Microsoft Exchange supports transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-specified conditions, then performs a user-specified action on mail that adheres to those conditions.\n Adversaries that abuse such features may be able to enable forwarding on all or specific mail an organization receives. , <strong>Source</strong>: MITRE <br><strong>URL</strong>: <a href='https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/003/'>Link Document</a> </br>", "2020", 1]

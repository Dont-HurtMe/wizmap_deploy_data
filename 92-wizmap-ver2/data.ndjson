The recent\n‘Flamer’\nspyware virus that targeted PCs in a number of Middle Eastern countries shows the international nature of the threat, and highlights the fact that attackers are developing highly specialised malware. Our success in countering these constantly evolving risks depends on our ability to share knowledge across borders - with governments, the IT industry, the academic world and with IT users. Working with organisations such as ISACA provides with a further opportunity to share good practice and support improved network and information security for all.”\nProfessor Helmbrecht will be participating as a panellist with Mr Marc Vael of ISACA and a representative from NIST – The US National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The report aims to bridge the gap between the legal framework and the available technological implementation measures. It provides an inventory of the existing approaches and privacy design strategies, and the technical building blocks of various degree of maturity from research and development. Limitations and inherent constraints are presented with recommendations for their mitigation.\nThe study, targeted at data protection authorities, policy makers, regulaltors, engineers and researchers, offers an insight into the technological aspect of the current state of the art. It presents the challenges and limitations of by-design principles for privacy and data protection, acts as a reference guide, and intends to improve the effectiveness of future policy in the area.\nThe main challenges identified in the report are two fold:\nExisting policy doesn’t offer a guarantee for compliance with privacy by design. New policy should give incentives for adopting privacy by design.\nNew standards for electronic communication need to consider privacy and data protection, while privacy and data protection-ignorant standards should be out-phased.\nFurthermore, privacy by design needs to be linked with the practice taking usability into account.\nFor the full report:\nPrivacy and Data Protection by Design - from policy to engineering\nBackground:\nPrivacy constitutes a core value of individuals and democratic societies. Decades of debate have gone into the manner of embedding these values and legal obligations into systems, preferably from the beginning of the design process.

It is present nowadays at the basis of server and desktop infrastructures, cloud computing, networking, and containerization.\nVirtualized environments are pervasively adopted and therefore increasingly becoming targets of cyber-attacks. More and more elaborated and specialized attacks are currently devised to exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses at the virtualization layer. The recent and widespread adoption of virtualization technologies has changed the traditional view of ICT, as virtualization can provide a dramatic increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of complex organizations and communities. It is also expected to constitute an important technological pillar of a thriving data-driven economy and the European single digital market.\nHowever, virtualization technologies bear a number of different security risks, some of them shared with traditional computing environments including issues affecting operating systems, communication protocols, and applications, which can be even exacerbated by the presence of virtualized components, producing a greater security impact.  On the other side, virtualization also introduces a number of specific security issues requiring ad hoc solutions.\nFull report\nis available\nonline\nFor interviews and press enquiries\nplease contact\npress@enisa.europa.eu\nTel\n. +30 2814409576"]

Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign.\n Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory (AD) domains, and local/external IP addresses.\nGuardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. This use of guardrails is distinct from typical \n. While use of \n may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match.\nAdversaries may identify and block certain user-agents to evade defenses and narrow the scope of their attack to victims and platforms on which it will be most effective.

Breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.\nDevices such as routers and firewalls can be used to create boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks.  They achieve this by restricting traffic types to enforce organizational policy in an attempt to reduce the risk inherent in such connections.

Use of MFA is recommended and provides a higher level of security than usernames and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms. \nIf a smart card is used for multi-factor authentication, then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use. With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token. \nAdversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID. Capturing token input (including a user's personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e. replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given access to both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended temporary codes). \nOther methods of MFA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate. It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS). If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception.

Methods of I/O image manipulation may include overriding the I/O table via direct memory manipulation or using the override function used for testing PLC programs. \n During the scan cycle, a PLC reads the status of all inputs and stores them in an image table. \n The image table is the PLCs internal storage location where values of inputs/outputs for one scan are stored while it executes the user program. After the PLC has solved the entire logic program, it updates the output image table. The contents of this output image table are written to the corresponding output points in I/O Modules. \nOne of the unique characteristics of PLCs is their ability to override the status of a physical discrete input or to override the logic driving a physical output coil and force the output to a desired status.\n"]

Malicious modifications to NAT may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.\nNetwork devices such as routers and firewalls that connect multiple networks together may implement NAT during the process of passing packets between networks.

By manipulating transmitted data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, or decision making.\nManipulation may be possible over a network connection or between system processes where there is an opportunity to deploy a tool that will intercept and change information. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target transmission mechanism as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system, typically gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign, in order to have the desired impact.\nOne method to achieve \n is by modifying the contents of the device clipboard. Malicious applications may monitor clipboard activity through the \n interface on Android to determine when clipboard contents have changed.

Security researchers have released a new toolkit designed to help victims of Black Basta Ransomware. This toolkit can recover stolen files.  SR Labs Research revealed in a recent GitHub post that these tools exploit a weakness in Black Basta's encryption algorithm. Analysis indicates that files can be recovered, whether fully or partially, depending on the file size. Files smaller than 5,000 bytes cannot be recovered.  Files between 5,000 bytes and 1GB can be fully recovered. For files larger than 1GB, the first 5,000 bytes will be lost, but the rest can be recovered.  The tool works when Black Basta encrypts files with only zeros, which is why it only works with larger files. However, the decryption tool will only work with Black Basta Ransomware used in attacks around April 2023. Black Basta is one of the most successful ransomware-as-a-service operations, generating over US$100 million since April 2022. "]

The lack of checksum functionality in a protocol removes the first application-level check of data that can be used. The end-to-end philosophy of checks states that integrity checks should be performed at the lowest level that they can be completely implemented.

The way that organisations communicate, both internally, and externally with other emergency responders, can make the difference between a serious situation developing into a crisis that can have life-changing or even fatal consequences.\n\nThis report  looks at how the technology and processes used in emergency response could be improved, with the aim of providing guidance to policymakers in EU Member States and EU organisations.\nFor the report, interviews were conducted with a range of people working directly in crisis response, as well as representatives from regulatory areas and service provision. The aim was to identify good practices and highlight potential gaps and barriers to effective crisis communications.  In post-crisis reviews of major incidents, inter-agency communications are often identified as a problem. The report highlights a range of issues that can contribute to difficulties, and which, if corrected, could make emergency communications far more effective.

At this point the process can be unmapped using APIs calls such as \n or \n  before being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via \n, \n, \n, then \n respectively.\nThis is very similar to \n but creates a new process rather than targeting an existing process. This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting process. However, execution via process hollowing may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. \n; cluster14"]

Researchers from the security firm c/side found that the malware uses the domain wp3[.]xyz to send data to the attacker's server. After successfully compromising a system, the malicious script creates an account named \"wpx_admin\" with a password specified in the code. It then installs a plugin named plugin.php, which collects data such as administrator accounts and logs, and sends the data disguised as image requests to evade security detection.  C/side states that the malware also includes steps to verify the success of the attack, such as checking whether the account and plugin have been created and activated, to systematically track the status of the attack. For prevention, c/side recommends blocking the wp3[.]xyz domain using firewalls and security tools, checking administrator accounts and installed plugins for unusual activity, and adding CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection using short-lived server-side tokens.

Romania's Intelligence Service revealed that the country's election systems were subjected to over 85,000 cyberattacks. Attackers gained access to election-related website data and disseminated it on Russian cybercrime forums before the presidential election. Intelligence agencies suggest these attacks may be linked to user account breaches or exploitation of training server vulnerabilities.  Heavy attacks occurred on election day and the night after, December 6, 2024.  Romania's Constitutional Court annulled the entire election process due to a lack of transparency and interference, ordering the government to set a new election date and develop an action plan to restart the electoral process from scratch.  Meanwhile, the pro-Russian candidate, Calin Georgescu, was heavily promoted on TikTok via coordinated accounts and paid advertising, leading to his questionable victory.  Romania's Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) believes Russia employed tactics to interfere in Eastern European elections, viewing Romania as an \"enemy\" due to its support for NATO and Ukraine. This interference includes disinformation campaigns, propaganda, and backing anti-EU agendas.

Kaspersky researchers discovered a new type of ransomware called Ymir being used in attacks alongside the RustyStealer malware, a data-stealing program that infiltrates victim systems before deploying the ransomware.  Ymir attacks networks containing sensitive information, with RustyStealer utilizing techniques to collect credentials and gain system access through privileged accounts. Once installed, Ymir encrypts system files and creates a ransom note in a PDF file to coerce payment.  It also modifies Windows settings to display warning messages on the login screen to further pressure victims into complying with the hackers' demands.  Ymir ransomware operates stealthily by running in memory and uses ChaCha20 encryption, an advanced encryption algorithm, to encrypt data, making decryption difficult.

Thailand Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT) 333/67 (IT) Friday, September 20, 2024. GitLab has released an update to address a Critical vulnerability affecting the Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). This is a SAML authentication bypass, tracked as CVE-2024-45409, with a CVSS score of 10. The vulnerability stems from an issue in GitLab's OmniAuth-SAML and Ruby-SAML libraries, which are used to manage SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) authentication.  This issue arises when the SAML response sent by the Identity Provider (IdP) to GitLab is misconfigured or modified. This allows attackers to craft malicious SAML responses to trick GitLab into recognizing the attacker as an authenticated user, bypassing SAML authentication and gaining access to the GitLab instance.  The vulnerability affects GitLab versions 17.3.3, 17.2.7, 17.1.8, 17.0.8, and 16.11.10. GitLab has updated OmniAuth SAML to version 2.2.1 and Ruby-SAML to version 1.17.0 and recommends users update to the latest versions as soon as possible. For those who cannot update immediately, GitLab recommends enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for all accounts and setting SAML 2FA bypass to \"Disallow\". ; cluster7"]

Researchers found that a hacker group linked to the North Korean government used job scams to penetrate the energy and space industries. They spread new malware called MISTPEN, a previously undiscovered backdoor. Cybersecurity firm Mandiant stated that the group, known as UNC2970 or Lazarus Group, uses tactics impersonating recruiters from leading companies to trick managers or senior executives into opening files containing hidden malware, particularly in the energy and space industries in several countries, including the US, UK, and Singapore. This attack starts by sending emails or WhatsApp messages, tricking victims into opening ZIP files that appear to be job-related documents.  But when these PDF files are opened, they require the use of a modified Sumatra PDF program to inject malware into the victim's system. MISTPEN is malware designed to be installed on the system and controlled via a command-and-control server.

One of the deceased is the child of a Hezbollah member of parliament, while the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon was slightly injured. The exploded pagers are the latest model recently adopted by Hezbollah. Experts believe this may be a Supply Chain Attack, where the pagers might have been modified before delivery to detonate when remotely controlled. CNN reported that the pagers may have been tampered with during manufacturing or transportation, leading to this attack.

Website security company Sucuri warns that more than 39,000 websites are infected with a new family of malware that redirects website visitors to fraudulent domains and unwanted advertisements. The name Sign1 comes from the discovery of JavaScript malware in WordPress custom HTML widgets or within the Simple Custom CSS and JS WordPress plugin that attackers added to compromised websites. Using this method, hackers spread malware to websites without placing malicious code in server files, allowing the malware to go unnoticed for long periods, as it is common for security providers to scan website files for malware rather than checking databases. The injected code is responsible for changing the URL to be executed in the victim's browser every 10 minutes, but only if the visitor comes from major websites such as Facebook, Google, Instagram, and Yahoo. In the past six months, Sucuri has identified more than 39,000 websites infected with various forms of this malware, and recently more than 2,500 websites have been infected in the past two months. Therefore, maintaining security, system administration, and website monitoring should be a top priority for website owners. ; cluster7"]

Researchers from Consumer Reports (CR) have discovered serious vulnerabilities in wireless video doorbell products manufactured by Eken Group Ltd. from China under the brands EKEN and Tuck.  These are sold at major retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, Shein, and Sears.  The security flaws could allow malicious actors to view video from the devices or take complete control of them. Attackers can exploit the flaws to create accounts in the application and access the doorbell products by pairing them with other devices.  Malicious actors can then view images and lock out the device owners. Steve Blair, CR's privacy and security testing engineer, found at least 10 other similar-looking doorbell camera products sold under different brand names, all controlled through the same mobile app called Aiwit, owned by EKEN.
